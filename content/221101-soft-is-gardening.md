This year and the last I saw my relationship with work transform itself.

To be fair, it wasn't only a change in my perception of work, it was also an economic shift that allowed my mind to float in much calmer waters.

I've always had no money at all, and it's been a bit more than a year since I finally have some money saved. It does wonders to your state of mind. Because I felt so safe I could join the [coolest adventure](wireless-hippie.github.io/martian/) I've ever boarded in my life. I could take time and choose a job that really resonated with me. And I had the space to realize that I'm no longer stumbling around in the bits and bytes soup anymore, I can actually arrange them and tame them to my will (most of the time).

Gaining this understanding allowed me to feel much more relaxed about my work. Most of my anxiety crises related to my self-worth related to work are gone. That means no more stressy afternoons staring at blank walls echoing my thoughts of emptiness and inadequacy, nor more long coding nights filled with guilt for not being able to finish or understand enough during the working hours, no more struggle with impostor syndrome, no more fear of asking questions, courage to look people in the eyes and contest their ideas, breath through endless discussions and see everyone is lost and mostly just want to be heard and calmness and patience to tackle any huge hairy bug that shows up.

It also gave me peace to pursue other passions - now that I've done it. Now that I'm finished proving to myself and others that I'm a capable smart girl that can write and read the nerd ancient characters. (I know it's not the ideal way to make peace with this part of me, but it's the way I was able to do it, and I'm grateful).

Now, I have the time and space to pursue other passions. Currently, I'm enjoying two, together with my software development: One of them is working with earth, I've written about it before, in other corners of the internet, about my interest in permaculture and land regeneration. Another passion is understanding governance and building a better solution than our current capitalist/democratic system to organize people. I've also written about it and how I'm trying to couple this with open source development, check my [main website](https://psychonautgirl.space), if you're curious.

I coupled these two passions together. I'm at the [TDF community](traditionaldreamfactory.com) project working with the earth.

I meditate and do yoga.
I plant trees and vegetables, I feed the cats, clean, cook, fix the gray water system, I have insightful thought-provoking conversations and then I sit and I code for a while. I stop for a communal lunch and smile at people I'm slowly coming to love.
I'm a software engineer again.
I move around. Listen to my best friend beautifully play the piano while I read one of the books from the shelf.
We discuss about deep learning methods we want to implement in the software we're writing together.
We have dinner under the most beautiful ceiling crowned with stars.
We have ceremonies to connect with each other, our ancestry, the earth.
We sleep in beautiful comfortable spacious tents.

And then!
We start all over again. And do different things every day, even the things that are the same feel different.
It's never consuming, never tiring, never less, never more.

I guess this post is both a written self-reflection of what I noticed in the last few months about who I am professionally and also an invitation for fellow software engineers to experiment with pursuing their passions alongside with software. The times I pursued my dreams intensily (moved countries, changed my life style completely) is when I feel most happy and accomplished with my software work. Even when it's completely unrelated with the dreams, like now.

Wishing you all love and brightness for a happy life. Spaciousness and peace to pursue your dreams.
