This year and the last I saw my relationship with work transform itself.

To be fair, it wasn't only a change in my perception of work, it was also an economic shift that allowed my mind to float in much calmer waters.

I've always had no money at all, and it's been a bit more than a year since I finally have some money saved. It does wonders to your state of mind. Because I felt so safe I could join the [coolest adventure](wireless-hippie.github.io/martian/) I've ever boarded in my life. I could take time and choose a job that really resonated with me. And I had the space to realize that I'm not stumbling around in the bits and bytes soup, I can actually arrange them and tame them to my will (most of the time).

Gaining this understanding allowed me to feel much more relaxed about my work. Most of my anxiety crises related to my self-worth related to work are gone. That means no more stressy afternoons staring at blank walls echoing thoughts of emptiness and inadequacy, nor more long coding nights filled with guilt for not being able to finish or understand enough during the working hours, no more struggle with impostor syndrome, no more fear of asking questions, courage to look people in the eyes and contest their ideas, breath through endless discussions and see everyone is lost and mostly just want to be heard.

It also gave me peace to pursue other passions. Now that I've done it. I've finished proving to myself and others that I'm a capable smart girl that can write and read the nerd characters. (I know it's not the ideal way of accomplishing peace with this part of me, but it's the way I was able to do it). Now, I have the time and space to pursue other passions. One of them is working with earth. I've written about it before in other corners of the internet about my interest in permaculture and land regeneration. Another passion is understanding governance and building a better solution than our current capitalist/democratic system to organize people. I've also written about it and how I'm trying to couple this with open source development, check my [main website](https://psychonautgirl.space), if you're curious.

This month I coupled these two passions together. I'm at the TDF community project working with earth.

I feel so productive and happy here.

I meditate and do yoga.
I plant trees and vegetables, I feed the cats, clean, cook, fix the gray water system, I have insightful thought-provoking conversations and then I sit and I code for a while. I stop for a communal lunch and smile at people I'm slowly coming to love.
I'm a software engineer again.
I move around. Listen to my best friend beautifully playing the piano while I read one of the books from the shelf.
We discuss about deep learning methods we want to implement in the software we're writing together.
We have dinner under the most beautiful ceiling crowned with stars.
We have ceremonies to connect with each other, our ancestry, the earth.
We sleep in beautiful comfortable spacious tents.

And then!
We start all over again. And do different things every day, even the things that are the same feel different.
