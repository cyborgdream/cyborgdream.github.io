In the morning I had a small Data Science intro talk with Zane. I'm thinking about exploring the data of shitcoins and their relation to twitter communication (by crawling twitter with a keyword, note this is part of SATAN and would be great if I could get this going!). I need to learn how to scrape the data from the blockchain. I bet there are websites with easy APIs.

At work I'm improving mamba's discerniment on strings. Creating a little tokenizer + evaluator of logical expressions using the help of [booleval](https://github.com/m-peko/booleval).

The craziest sand storm happened while we trew a party in the desert. So my computer progress was mined by it.
