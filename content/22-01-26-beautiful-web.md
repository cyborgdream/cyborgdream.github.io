Today I'm working, but it's been hard to focus on it. Not sure if it's because it's my version of Friday or just Mars is a very interesting place.
Could also be because I have to compile mamba every time I want to see a change and that takes me from 2 to 3 minutes and multi tasking is the poison of the brain.

Today I advanced the vape project a little further, we discussed a bit of electronics. Friday we have another meeting where we present good open source ideas to build the vapes.

I also attended the AI workshop but since it wasn't so super interactive Flo and I ended up creating a script to upvote a penis picture in the website we were using. [Check it out](https://abraham.ai/creations), if you click on ðŸ¤² or ðŸ”¥ should be the top one, if it isn't, feel free:
