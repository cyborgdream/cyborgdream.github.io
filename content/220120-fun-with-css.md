After such a full day I'm dealing with a little bit of a burnout. I don't feel like going outside, but staying in front of my computer is not proving to be very effective, so I came here to update my blog.

I didn't drink a single drop of water today, I'm living on chai and I'm still sleepy.

I ended up having a nice day (of course), all days are nice in Mars.

I've started re-writing a small CSS library to update my website in a cute win98's girly vaporwave theme. And I did some CSS tricks that are on my past dead cringy [codepen](https://codepen.io/marimeireles/pen/NWaZpbJ) now.

Next steps are changing this [lib](https://github.com/marimeireles/98.css?organization=marimeireles&organization=marimeireles) and making it perfect.

I also found a website called [neocities.com](neocities.com), completely perfect for inspiration.
