So, this is so I don't forget, I'll have to use the [hyper](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/) library to deal with the protocol stuff. But today, I should prepare for my Python talk that I'm giving this Saturday @Python Pizza Hamburg, a conference that should have been in person but was fucked up by German's authorities not getting their shit together to keep corona under control. Anyways, today I'll focus on this and this is the [link](https://github.com/marimeireles/talks/blob/master/README.md) to find the most updated version of this talk.
