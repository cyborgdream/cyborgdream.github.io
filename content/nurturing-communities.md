Didn't have so much time for coding. But I was able to clean my inbox of some small stuff that I let pending for far too long on some communities I try to nurture.

I love doing stuff for people, specially when it's old internet friends people. When I see them again on the repos is very refreshing and uplifiting, makes me happy and feel like I'm part of a loving community.
