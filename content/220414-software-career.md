The software career. One of the freest industries out there.

Where else could you hold a serious blog on sex toys and still have your career intact? (The sex industry, I guess...) Of course these privileges only fall upon male -because everyone is so interested on women's in tech personal life- but still, it's a wonder to see and be part of it in some extent.

This whole topic about how much work control people's personal choices is interesting to me.

Can you be sexist and still be in the managing board of the biggest open source OS out there? Are you too powerful and your views are harmful and unfair to the non-male population and that's why you should be removed?

I'm reading The righteous mind and the author says that the reason why we come up with moral justifications is not for ourselves, but to convince others of our points of views.

We're all telling stories to each other to try to fit in in groups.

When you work in global projects, how can you accommodate so many different cultures and perspectives inside of it? If a person comes from a culture where women must submit to men simply because they're considered to be inferior in all intellectual subjects, what should we do? What should we do when I am a woman and in my moral perspective I am equal to a men in intellectual capacity and feel like I should be heard and considered as equal? How do you even enforce something like this in someone else's moral? According to the writer of the book is not possible. A moral stand is an understanding that comes from something like a gut feeling and prohibiting or enforcing something will only make people close themselves even more to the ideas defying their moral. I think this is correct, because as a past social warrior myself, I've seen that happen countless times.

It's a delicate and difficult process the one to approximate cultures and even if done right, you have to choose to which cultures you're going to optimize your project for. This example on women intelligence is too simple, but there are so many other problems that I would personally feel very uncomfortable to impose my culture on top of other people's. Specially, because even though their culture might sound terrible to me in my privileged European middle-class context, it might make a lot of sense to them, where they're coming from.

I wonder if mutual respect and understanding of differences is all that is necessary to have a peaceful coexistence.
