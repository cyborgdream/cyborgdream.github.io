Just got back to work, was my first day. A full day of maintaining libraries, replying comments and PRs and general house-keeping. There's so much non-code work in open source, specially at my job, I feel like, since we provide libraries and softwares to people, all of them have to theoretically be able to run everywhere and that's a lot of work!

In the afternoon we had the first webdev meeting and I decided to have fractals in my webiste.

I want to implement moving fractals.

1. Which lib is best?
    1.1 3js or p5js or something else?
        Seems like p5js is the way to go if you're going 2d. Seems like I should start here. But Snaeys knows a lot about 3js.
        But I bet p5js is lighter, so I'm going for this one, also way simpler. Seems like the way to go with 3js is using GLSL shader language, whatever that is (fancy things to game devs?).

2. How to generate fractals?

    Exploring fractals I found [this](https://breaksome.tech/coding-phyllotaxis-patterns-in-p5js/), I want to eventualy do something with phyllotaxis just because 3blue1brown is super cool.

I've never checked the code for fractals but they're so simple! Recursion is pure black magic. 
They're so pretty that I feel like I'll be inspired to work on them even outside of webdev meetup hours.

At night we had a lot of very interesting tech talks. I loved to listen to the people in our community talk about what they love, it's super inspiring. I'll tag along some tech projects for sure!
