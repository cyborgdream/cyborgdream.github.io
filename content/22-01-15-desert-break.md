Wow! So it's been a while :)
I'm currently in [mars.college](mars.college) and this is the first day that's officially off the building week. I'm excited to jump back into the cyber world.
I also hope to update this more frequently now that I'm coming back to work next week. Initally a full-time position for a week and then down to 3 full time days a week.

Mars college has been an amazing experience and I can't wait to see what I'll produce here (tech-wie and not). I currently write this blog from the top of the Cahuilla building and watch the clouds slowly turn pink as the sun hides in the mountains in my back.

I've built some super tiny amount of code in the last few weeks for a project that's not open source, so I can't share here :(

But today, I came back to my Rust explorations. Here's my progress:

Not a lot of progress.
I'm getting back to it, there's so much context to get again.
