On the 25th, I didn't write, but here's what I remember:

* I wrote some TODO lists for the different projects I'm engajed on, let's see how this helps me to be organized about things;
* I made a little tiny bit of progress in the data project. Now I have a good website to scrape the data from. I need to first figure out how to do that, and put it on a python script. Then I need to look at it and think of ways of doing things with it. I want to have the data ready before next class so Zane can teach me how to make candle stick analysis with it, maybe we can actually turn it into a workshop for more people;

That's all tech-wise!
