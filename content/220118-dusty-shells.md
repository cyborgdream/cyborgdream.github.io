I spent basically the whole day yesterday trying to fix a bug and I couldn't, but this morning during the team meeting I just had a vision from god and I hope to make it.

It worked!

I checked to see if Rhumba was running with the newer versions of the mamba C API. All good, you can use Rhumba, the absolute best and fastest R package manager in the world. It's so crazy how this is the most impactful thing I ever wrote but no one cares. I love it a little bit more because of it.

I'm also checking some cool Qt code I abandoned for three months now and a colleague got it working. Seems like a nice job and I'll finish checking it out tomorrow, probably.

More tech talks during the night, I found a bunch of partners in crime for my tech ideas and some people creating such amazing art I really want to tag along with them! Might be talking about game development soon!
