Software engineering was always about love to me.

I grew up in a very technological house hold. I used to live on a farm when I was a kid, and we were very poor. But my father came from a rich family, he was a very culturally rich person and we always had computers at home. I was very furtunate because of that. After 14 years, we eventually overcame poverty thanks to left wing politics and he became a software engineer. But even before he joins university and finishes his degree I knew I wanted to work with something related with computers.

I used to built "robots" out of stuff I'd find around the house and by magic hope they'd come to life and interact with me. I always wanted to be an inventor, like in the cartoons, a crazy scientist of sorts. I think being a software engineer is pretty close to that.

>(Ok, to be honest, I wanted to be the leader of a wolf pack for quite a while, but capitalism convinced me that was a bad idea).

When the time to university came I was pushed in to an Electrical Engineering degree I ended up hating. That was 6 years ago. I left my parents house and had to transform myself into a real adult from one day to the other, feeling the soul crushing pressure of capitalism over poor people, while studying in an abusive environment that couldn't care less for my personal difficulties and would treat me the same as my super rich pampered peers. That and some other factors sank me on a deep depression that I think I just truly let go off after a while having moved in to Berlin.

The thing is, for 6 years I have been pushing through life so hard and now I'm a bit tired from it. I took a month off break of being a software engineer, but I'm longing to come back to it. However, I don't want to feel bound to work for now, so I start with this post a series of posts that will go for an indefinite period of time (as long as I'm not working, very likely) and on them I intend to reconnect with my love for coding, tech and software. Going back to simpler times when I was just building robots out of junk and expecting that magic would make them alive!

Now I'm older and smarter and hopefully I can actually create some magic with my opensourcerer fingers!

Here's some ideas for projects I'm interested in tackling in no order of interest:

These were moved to [here](https://github.com/cyborgdream/cyborgdream.github.io/tree/master#readme) due to the changing nature of this list.

These ideas are so very broad. I'm very interested in starting this "Create a web browser" though.

See you tomorrow when I've done some progress on my choices and/or on the browser development!
