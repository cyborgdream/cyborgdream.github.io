In the beggining there were computers.

They were always a synonim of love to me. They were the safe shores that'd comfort me after a tough day in school. They were the attention and love of my dad and how we connected the best.

I was born in a farm and even though my core family was very poor, my extended family was not. That gave me plenty of benefits to enjoy a culturally rich life permeated with technology since my infancy. (Which was very very rare for Brazil countryside by the end of 90's, beginning of 20s).

As a kid, I wanted to be an invetor, or a crazy scientist, like the ones I'd see in the cartoons. I used to built "robots" out of stuff I'd find around the house and hope that through the right encantation the pieces I put together would make my creature to come to life and interact with me. I think developing software is pretty close to that.

Okay, to be fair, I also wanted to be the leader of a wolf pack for quite a while, but when I turned 14 and I realized I should start thinking about my career I was convinced it wasn't a great idea.

When the time to university came I didn't choose to study computer science (even though I could have!). I was accepted in a really good university in Brazil and could choose between any of the most prestigious courses, my family not so gently nudged me into choosing electrical engineering. I thought I could build robots there and learn software development but that didn't happen. That was 6 years ago.

It was very troubled times in my household and I was going through some deep personal and transformative experiences at the time. I decided to leave my parents house and live by myself.

Little did I know what I was getting into. Suddenly there I was, all by myself for the first time in my life. I had a weird contractor job with Facebook in which they could kick me out at any time (and they eventually did), no money saved and a bunch of confusing dreams and hopes. I had to transform myself into an adult and I thought it'd be alright, people do that all the time, right? But I didn't have many of the safety structures that a lot of the people that I was thinking about had. I've been through - what I can now look back and say - the most difficult years of my life. Feeling the soul crushing pressure of capitalism, surviving in a poor unequal society, studying in an abusive environment that couldn't care less for my personal difficulties, fighting a system that homogeonized me as a rich, privileged kid.

This dark storm of feelings and events sank me into deep depression. I fought it for many years. And I won. I quit my university and it was the most liberating impactful thing I ever did in my life. I'm so grateful for the people I met and the experiences I lived in that place but also deeply hurt by its toxity and animosity. I became a software engineer. I got a cool job. I did it. But I did it for survival reasons, I had lost my connection with the magic. I was grinding, I was making money, I was studying hard things I didn't care about because that's what my employers wanted from me.

For 6 years I have been pushing through life so hard and I'm finally very tired of it. I took a few months off from work thanks to the amazing German health care system. I said, I'm tired, and it was fine, I could actually take a break. Now I feel much better and I'm longing to get back to developing software.

However, I don't want to feel bound to work for now, so I start with this post a series of posts that will go for an indefinite period of time (as long as I'm not working, very likely) and on them I intend to reconnect with my love for coding, tech and software. Going back to love when I was just building robots out of junk and expecting that magic would bring them to life.

Now I'm older and smarter and hopefully I can actually create some magic with my opensourcerer fingers!

Here's some ideas for [projects](https://github.com/cyborgdream/cyborgdream.github.io/tree/master#readme) I'm interested in tackling.

These ideas are so very broad. I'm very interested in starting this "Create a web browser" though.

See you tomorrow when I've done some progress on my choices and/or on the browser development!
