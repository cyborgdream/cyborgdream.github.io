Saturday after party. No better day to develop some crawler code in Rust to prove my point with shitcoins for the data project.

A lot of people in the desert are really into crypto, which, well, breaks my heart a little. Bitcoin is completely sunk and a few of the more irresponsible ones are not happy at all.

I've did two things in SATAN and stopped.

Not a day for coding.
