overview\nThere are many different uses for cache in the web: but mostly it's server and client cache.\nServer cache is stored on the site's server. They can be CDN cachings, which load geographically relevant content, this is done in a level of Webmasters, it's also called Gateway caches. Opcode caching or Proxy cache(?), store stuff like DBs, or result of compiled files. It's shared on a level of ISP.\n\nI wonder how caching of WASM works?\n\nHow web caches works\n\nFresh representations are served directly from the cache, they're valid when their expiring time is still good.\nUnder certain circumstances a cache can serve stale responses.\n\nIf the HTTP request doesn't contain an ETag or Last-Modified, and it doesn't have any explicit freshness information the info. will usually be considered uncacheable. (But as we'll see later on, it's possible to create some heuristics).\nControling caches\nSo, some ways of controlling it is by using HTML tags. They're easy to use, but not very effective because when a document has to go through a proxy, there aren't many that are doing their job and obeing the conventions. A Pragma: no-cache won't necessarily keep the page fresh.\nDepending on the server you use though, you actually have some level of control over your headers.\nExpire allows you to put any date. It's good for things that don't change in the long run. The clock on the Web server and the clock on wherever you're storing info. on the cache have to be synchronized for this to work well. Another issue, is that it's easy to forget you set that specific time for your cache.\nHTTP 1.1 has a bunch of Cache-Control commands:\n\nmax-age=[seconds] — specifies the maximum amount of time that a representation will be considered fresh. Similar to Expires, this directive is relative to the time of the request, rather than absolute. [seconds] is the number of seconds from the time of the request you wish the representation to be fresh for.\n\n\n\ns-maxage=[seconds] — similar to max-age, except that it only applies to shared (e.g., proxy) caches.\n\n\npublic — marks authenticated responses as cacheable; normally, if HTTP authentication is required, responses are automatically private.\n\n\nprivate — allows caches that are specific to one user (e.g., in a browser) to store the response; shared caches (e.g., in a proxy) may not.\n\n\nno-cache — forces caches to submit the request to the origin server for validation before releasing a cached copy, every time. This is useful to assure that authentication is respected (in combination with public), or to maintain rigid freshness, without sacrificing all of the benefits of caching.\n\n\nno-store — instructs caches not to keep a copy of the representation under any conditions.\n\n\nmust-revalidate — tells caches that they must obey any freshness information you give them about a representation. HTTP allows caches to serve stale representations under special conditions; by specifying this header, you’re telling the cache that you want it to strictly follow your rules.\n\n\nproxy-revalidate — similar to must-revalidate, except that it only applies to proxy caches.\n\n\nValidators:\nIt's a way of checking if the info. is fresh without really having to download the entire representation. That's what ETags are, they were introduced in 1.1 too.\nCaveats\nPragma: is not specified for HTTP responses and is therefore not a reliable replacement for the general HTTP/1.1 Cache-Control header.\nPragma should only be used for backwards compatibility with HTTP/1.0 caches where the Cache-Control HTTP/1.1 header is not yet present.\nFiles that are infrequently updated: you use a technique called revving. These files are named in a specific way, in their URL a revision number is added. To be able to get a new version of this file you need to pull a new file and for the user to be able to do that you have to serve a new file (and apparently rename it everywhere) but I don't really understand where.\nFreshness lifetime:\nIn case none of the headers can be found, a heuristic freshness checking approach might be applicable. First, you look for a Last-Modified header, then you look for the current date. Date - Last-Modified = current freshness.\nVary:\nVary is a good thing because allows you to know if a cached response can be used or if a fresh one must be requested from the origin server. It's usually used to allow a resource to be cached in uncompressed and various compressed forms.\nOne caveat of Vary is that you should normalize your data, if you have stuff like Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch, Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate, Accept-Encoding: gzip, you're gonna have different requests to store the same data 3x if it's a gzipe. So you should write functions to normalize the Vary type to treat everything as gzip once.\nFirefox caching\nFirefox has different fluxes for different kinds of caches. (Only partical content, when the thing to be cached doesn't pass server revalidation).\nThis system is also thread safe, and it has an order of priority:\n\nopen\nread\nmanagement (for the memory pool and CacheEntry background operations)\nclose\nindex (index is being rebuild here (?)I don't really understand what this means)\nevict (files that are overreaching disk space consumption limit are evicted)\n\nIt seems like they use a hashtable mapped by a scope key to keep hashtables of cache entries. Access to the tables are protected by a global lock.\nThere's something called intermediate memory caching... Which is super tiny and frequently used metadata fits in there.\n\nI should probably revisit threading again, maybe a little about loops\n\nMemory systems, Cache, DRAM, Disk\nThis book is soo low level.\n\nWhat's scratch-pad memories\n\nWuuh, way over my head. Less parties next time.\n","id":"https://cyborgdream.github.io/caching/","title":"Caching on the web"},"https://cyborgdream.github.io/cmake-personal-universe/":{"body":"This is part of a series where I write down things I know or I've learned while trying to keep myself sharp in various subjects that I don't use so often anymore.\nFirst, you might be confused about Make and CMAKE, like I was when I learned about both. Make is a much simpler system that’s not cross platform compatible. CMAKE is also just a better system at handling complex build systems, it also contains robust mechanisms to locate libraries and executables. CMake is primarily a build system generator, not a build tool itself. It sets up the environment for building but delegates the actual compilation and installation to native build tools (like Make).\n\n\nList all of the commands and a short description about them organized by phase they should be added in your CMake file:\nProject declaration:\n\n\nproject: Sets the name and version of the project. This command also sets useful variables like PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_VERSION, and more.\n\n\ncmake_minimum_required: Sets the minimum required version of CMake for a project, ensuring compatibility and proper interpretation of the CMake scripts.\n\n\n**target_compile_features**: You will also need to set the language version you’re using.\ntarget_compile_features(particles PUBLIC cxx_std_11)\n\n\n\nGlobal variable declaration and flags:\n\nset: Used to define and set CMake variables that control various aspects of the build process.\noption: Introduces a boolean option that the user can control from the command line. It's useful for conditional compilation or including optional features.\n\nInclude directories:\n\ninclude_directories: Is used to add directory paths to the list of directories that the compiler will search for include files during the compilation process.\n\nIt’s the same as running cmake -I path/to/dir. It simply adds a  directory for the CMAKE to bundle header files in there with source files.\n\n\n\nFind dependencies:\n\n\nfind_package: Searches for and locates external libraries or packages, ensuring that the necessary dependencies are included in the build process. It's key for managing external dependencies.\n\nIn order to create your own find_package function you can just write a normal CMAKE file in which you. First you add the path to library, then you find the library itself, name it, then you include and handle any dependencies this library has (and add them to the CMAKE file) and then you can finally create a library with the the add_library function.\n\nfind_path(MY_LIB_INCLUDE_DIR MyLib.h)\nfind_library(MY_LIB_LIBRARY NAMES mylib)\n\ninclude(FindPackageHandleStandardArgs)\nfind_package_handle_standard_args(MyLib DEFAULT_MSG MY_LIB_INCLUDE_DIR MY_LIB_LIBRARY)\n\nif(MY_LIB_FOUND)\n  add_library(MyLib::MyLib UNKNOWN IMPORTED)\n  set_target_properties(MyLib::MyLib PROPERTIES\n    IMPORTED_LOCATION \"${MY_LIB_LIBRARY}\"\n    INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES \"${MY_LIB_INCLUDE_DIR}\")\nendif()\n\n\ninclude: the primary functionality of include is to include other CMAKE scripts into the code.\nbut you don’t need to create your own find_package every time, if the library is simple enough you can just add a few lines of code into your current CMAKE. In the following case we find the library and link it together with our executable target_link_libraries.\n\ninclude_directories(\"/path/to/library/include\")\nlink_directories(\"/path/to/library/lib\")\nadd_executable(my_app main.cpp)\ntarget_link_libraries(my_app libname)\n\n\nIt might seem counterintuitive to configure and then link things, but that’s just how CMAKE good standards go.\nREQUIRED key word: will throw an error if package not found\nMODULE key word: find_package searches for pkgs in two ways: through modules and through config. The config way it expects a FooConfig.cmake file that will look for a proper cmake configuration file and the module way is the usual way that packages that do not support CMAKE natively use and you have written it yourself something like Foo.cmake\nCONFIG: as explained in the previous point will look for a config file, which are simpler. Usually they can be automatically configured, for example.\nIf neither the CONFIG nor MODULE keywords are available than that means that CMAKE will try to look for pkgs both ways.\n\n\n\nAdd executable or library targets:\n\n\n**add_executable**: creates an executable from the specified source files. This executable is the final binary program that runs on a computer. It typically defines the main entry point for a program. In a build system you can have multiple targets, the add_executable specifically identifies one of the targets (libs, modules, tests…) as the executable, making it clear which component is the final runnable output. If you have different executables for different operational systems then you have it indicated through flags:\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)\nproject(MyProject)\n\n# Check the operating system\nif(WIN32)\n    # Windows-specific build\n    add_executable(MyExecutable_win main_windows.cpp)\n    # Additional Windows-specific configuration here\nelseif(APPLE)\n    # macOS-specific build\n    add_executable(MyExecutable_mac main_macos.cpp)\n    # Additional macOS-specific configuration here\nelseif(UNIX AND NOT APPLE)\n    # Linux/Unix-specific build\n    add_executable(MyExecutable_unix main_unix.cpp)\n    # Additional Unix-specific configuration here\nelse()\n    message(FATAL_ERROR \"Unsupported operating system\")\nendif()\n\n# Common configuration that applies to all executables\n# ...\n\n\n\n**add_library**: this builds a library from the source code. A library is a collection of pre-compilled code that can be reused in various program. This function will typically generate either static or shared(dynamic) libraries.\n\nHere’s a note on how the memory is divided between different software using dynamic libraries: the code itself is shared but because each process has their own memory when the processes need access to variables and such then the OS creates copies of those (no global state, etc) is shared by different processes\n\n\n\nLink libraries:\n\n\ntarget_link_libraries: is used to specify which libraries an executable target or another library should link against during the linking phase of the build process. When building an executable or a library that depends on other libraries, you need to link these libraries to your target. target_link_libraries is used for this purpose. It ensures that the linker knows which libraries to link to your target during the build process.\ntarget_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt; &lt;PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE&gt; &lt;item&gt;...)\n\n\nWhy use it? There’s a bunch of goodies that makes your life much easier:\n\nIt automatically handles the necessary compiler and liker flags for you\nIt deals with dependency management\nIf you use the PUBLIC or INTERFACE flags it will retroactively deal with the dependencies for you\n\n\nThe PRIVATE, PUBLIC, and INTERFACE flags relate to how you want to manage the visibility of the propagation of link dependencies and include paths in the project.\n\nPRIVATE: The linked libraries are used by the target, but their link dependencies and include paths are not propagated to other targets.\nPUBLIC: They are propagated to the projects that are using this library\nINTERFACE : Is meant for when you’re not compiling the target into a library but you still want the libraries that connect to it to be able to find and inherit its dependencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nSet target properties:\n\n\n**set_target_properties**: Can configure how the target (typically an executable or a shared library) finds its dependencies at runtime. It uses the RPATH variable for that. But it’s also used to a myriad of things: set properties can control various aspects of how the target is built and linked, such as compiler options, definitions, include directories, and more.\nset_target_properties(my_target PROPERTIES CXX_STANDARD 17)\nset_target_properties(my_target PROPERTIES COMPILE_DEFINITIONS \"DEBUG=1\")\nset_target_properties(my_target PROPERTIES INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES \"/path/to/includes\")\nset_target_properties(my_target PROPERTIES COMPILE_OPTIONS \"-Wall;-Wextra;-O2\")\nset_target_properties(my_target PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME \"my_custom_name\")\nset_target_properties(my_target PROPERTIES LINK_LIBRARIES \"lib1;lib2\")\n\n\nJust as a note -Wall and -Wextra are turning on warnings and -02 is an optimization flag that will try to hit a balance between space and speed for the result of the compilation.\nThese are going to override global settings.\n\n\n\ntarget_compile_definitions and target_compile_options: These commands add preprocessor definitions and compile options to a target, respectively. They offer fine-grained control over the compilation process.  But they’re kind of like set_target_properties.\n\n\ntarget_include_directories: The main difference between include_directories and target_include_directories is that the first one has a global scope, while the later sets the scope for a specific target. This should be used in more complex projects in which you have several targets with different include requirements.\n\n\nAdd custom commands and configurations:\n\n\nadd_custom_command and add_custom_target: These commands are used to add custom build steps and targets, allowing the execution of custom commands during the build process.\n\nWays of adding custom command. You can run scripts like so:\n\nadd_custom_target(\n    generate_docs\n    COMMAND doxygen Doxyfile\n    COMMENT \"Generating documentation with Doxygen\"\n)\n\n\nIt’s a kind of bash script within CMAKE, it will add a step to your make, for example with the previous case you can now run make generate_docs and this piece of code will run.\n\n\n\nExternalProject_Add: Adds a step to download, update, and build an external project. It's useful for integrating external code bases that are not part of the main project.\nExternalProject_Add(name\n    [GIT_REPOSITORY &lt;git_repo_url&gt;]\n    [GIT_TAG &lt;git_tag&gt;]\n    [SOURCE_DIR &lt;source_dir&gt;]\n    [BINARY_DIR &lt;binary_dir&gt;]\n    [CONFIGURE_COMMAND &lt;command&gt;]\n    [BUILD_COMMAND &lt;command&gt;]\n    [INSTALL_COMMAND &lt;command&gt;]\n    [...other options...]\n)\n\n\nIt’s a command that can handle the entire lifecycle of an external project.\n\n\n\nadd_subdirectory: Adds a subdirectory to the build. This is essential for structuring larger projects with multiple components or libraries.\n\n\nconfigure_file: Copies and processes a file, replacing variable references with their current values. Useful for generating configuration headers and similar tasks.\n\nAllows you to add variables to your files, like versioning for example.\n\n\n\nfile: Provides various file manipulation capabilities, such as generating a list of source files, copying files, etc.\n\n\nInstall:\n\n\ninstall: Specifies how and where files should be installed on the system when you run the make install command (or the installation step of your chosen build system).\n# Create an executable target\nadd_executable(my_app src/main.cpp)\n\n# Define where to install the executable\ninstall(TARGETS my_app DESTINATION bin)\n\n# Create a library target\nadd_library(my_lib SHARED src/my_lib.cpp)\n\n# Define where to install the library\ninstall(TARGETS my_lib LIBRARY DESTINATION lib)\n\n# Install header files\ninstall(DIRECTORY include/ DESTINATION include)\n\n\nTARGETS: Used to install targets, like executables or libraries. You specify the actual target names and where they should be installed (DESTINATION). The destination is usually relative to the installation prefix, which is typically /usr/local on Unix systems but can be set to a different value.\nLIBRARY, RUNTIME, ARCHIVE: Specify where different types of targets should be installed. LIBRARY is for shared libraries, RUNTIME for executables and DLLs, and ARCHIVE for static libraries.\nFILES: Used to install individual files. You specify the files and their destination.\nDIRECTORY: Used to install directories of files. It copies the contents of specified directories to a destination directory.\nCONFIGURATIONS: Optionally, you can specify configurations (like Debug, Release) for which the install rules apply.\nPERMISSIONS: You can set file permissions for Unix systems.\nCOMPONENT: Used for component-based installations, allowing users to select which components to install.\n\n\n\nTest:\n\nenable_testing and add_test: These commands are used to enable and add tests to a project. They integrate with CTest for managing test suites.\n\nPackage:\n\nCPack: CMake's packaging system, which is used to create installers and distributable packages for a project.\n\nIt’s used to create binaries and source pkgs. After running your project with CMAKE you run CPACK to generate the pkgs.\n\n\n\nOthers:\n\n**macro vs function**: macros don’t have a defined scope, while functions do.\nmessage: Generates a message during the CMake run. Useful for debugging or providing build-time information.\n\n\n\n","id":"https://cyborgdream.github.io/cmake-personal-universe/","title":"My CMake universe"},"https://cyborgdream.github.io/complicated-web/":{"body":"The simple web\nMaybe not so simple :-(\nA couple of months ago I wrote this workshop in the hope that I could teach package management, git and how to build and host your own static website all at once in a few hours.\nThe first iteration went well but the second time I've done it not so much, some code rot and a couple of the participants couldn't get their website up and running (so sorry for that folks!).\nCode rot is such an interesting problem to me, a relique of human interaction patterns. Knowledge gets lost and corrupt even if we don't have Alexandria disasters anymore.\nAnyway, I'm writing this blog post to address the problems we encountered on the workshop. It consists of two parts: the first one is how to fix the issue you encounter (if you encounter it) and how to upload your website.\nThe second part is offering an alternative to Jekyll and Ruby's convoluted system, by using HUGO which is a newer alternative that's very very similar to Jekyll but newer and less prone to code rot. It also offers slicker themes for your website.\nGetting things working\nIf you run into issues saying it's not possible to install the gems there are two different solutions you can try.\nInstalling ruby and jekyll with your local package manager\nIf you're on an OSX machine you can try to work around this problem by using brew.\nInstall it:\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\nThen install Ruby:\nbrew install ruby\nAnd Jekyll:\ngem install jekyll bundler\nYou might also need webrick:\ngem install webrick\nIf you're using Linux follow the same steps using your package manager + the gem step.\nIf you're on Windows, try to do the same but using Chocolatey.\nChanging environmental path\nyou might need to change some environmental files in your conda installation:\nGo to: ~/miniconda3/envs/$your_env_name/bin\nOpen the bundle file with a text editor, it should look like the following:\n#!/bin/sh\n# -*- ruby -*-\n# This file was generated by RubyGems.\n#\n# The application 'bundler' is installed as part of a gem, and\n# this file is here to facilitate running it.\n#\n_=_\\\n=begin\nbindir=\"${0%/*}\"\nexec \"$bindir/ruby\" \"-x\" \"$0\" \"$@\"\n=end\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\n\nrequire 'rubygems'\n\nversion = \"&gt;= 0.a\"\n\nstr = ARGV.first\nif str\n  str = str.b[/\\A_(.*)_\\z/, 1]\n  if str and Gem::Version.correct?(str)\n    version = str\n    ENV['BUNDLER_VERSION'] = str\n\n    ARGV.shift\n  end\nend\n\nif Gem.respond_to?(:activate_bin_path)\nload Gem.activate_bin_path('bundler', 'bundle', version)\nelse\ngem \"bundler\", version\nload Gem.bin_path(\"bundler\", \"bundle\", version)\nend\n\nYou need to change the following line exec \"$bindir/ruby\" \"-x\" \"$0\" \"$@\" to something that will look like exec \"/Users/$your_user_name/miniconda3/envs/sw/bin/ruby\" \"-x\" \"$0\" \"$@\". This path represents an OSX path but if you're using a different operational system it might look different for you.\nGenerating your website and putting it online\nOnce you have that working you can finally generate your website from the files we've downloaded, using the command:\nbundle exec jekyll serve\n\nAfter you've done this step. You should have your website up and running on your browser under the address http://127.0.0.1:4000/.\nTo see your changes online you need to git add $files all the generated content by this command, then commit it with a commit message using git commit -m \"your message\" then push it to your repository using git push.\nI don't want to deal with all of this code rot stuff\nFair enough, use HUGO!\nIf we were on a workshop I'd walk you through these instructions, but since we're not there's no way I do a better job that HUGO's documentation on how to get HUGO up and running.\nSame idea as Jekyll but without the gem, bundler overhead (thank god).\nHere's a quick summary of what you'll have to do:\nInstall hugo in your computer, choose a theme, download it, use git init to initialize a github repository, or if you already have a github repository running skip this step. Make your personal changes, run hugo -D to generate the files that will run in your browser. Run git add $files_you_produced, git commit -m \"your message\" your changes and finally git push.\nAs an extra step from the Jekyll system though is that you'll have to setup Github Actions, but don't worries, it's as simple as copying/pasting a new file into your repository. This file should be enough. Check the rest of the page if you're stuck in some other step with Github, might be helpful!\nOkay, so that's it!\nIf you have any questions about how to build your website and you're part of WocCodes cohort, you know how to find me!\nIf you just found this and need help, send me an email, I might be able to reply! ^-^\n","id":"https://cyborgdream.github.io/complicated-web/","title":"The not so simple web"},"https://cyborgdream.github.io/cpp-classes/":{"body":"So here we go, just so I don't forget again, this is what I'm running for my Rusty browser:\ncargo run http://example.org/index.html\nI should go through this: https://aminb.gitbooks.io/rust-for-c/content/borrowed/index.html\nBut not right now, because right now I'm going to read into C++ stuff and try to remember/learn some things about it. Starting with:\nClasses\nclass Date {\n    ...\n    Date (int, int, int);\n}\n\nDate today = Date(30, 6, 1999);\nDate tomorrow(23, 3, 1999);\n\nIt's often nice to provide several ways of initializing a class obj.\nclass Date {\n    int d, m, y;\n    public:\n    Date(int, int, int);\n    Date(int, int);\n    Date();\n    Date(const char*); //date represented as a string\n}\n\nConstructors obey the same overloading rules as functions.\nclass Date {\n    int d, m, y;\n    static Date default_date;\npublic:\n    Date(int dd=0, int mm=0, int yy=0);\n    static void set_default(int dd, int mm, int yy);\n\n    Date::Date(int dd, int mm, int yy)\n    {\n        d = dd ? dd : today.d;\n        ...\n        //checking that date is valid\n    }\n}\n\nconst after the empty argument list indicate that this function do not modifiy the state of a date. So, an example of a method like this:\ninline int Date::year() const\n{\n    return y;\n}\n\nReturning a bunch of *this in class methods allow us to chain methods:\nDate&amp; Date::add_year(int n)\n{\n    ...\n    return *this;\n}\n\n//repeat for day and month\n\nDate&amp; d;\nd.add_day(1).add_month(2)..add_year(3);\n\nUsing const_cast&lt;&gt; will cast away your const, but seems like it's not a good idea in general.\nI never remember the syntax to overload operators, so here it is:\ninline bool operator==(Date a, Date b)\n{\n    return a.day() == b.day &amp;&amp; a.month() == b.month() &amp;&amp; a.year() == b.year();\n}\n\nMost classes have a default constructor. (When they don't need arguments).\nLocal static objects are destroyed at the same time as a global one.\nWhen you do something like the following:\nTable t1;\nTable t2 = t1;\nTable t3;\nt3 = t2;\n\nThe constructor here is called 2x, for t1 and t3, but the destructor is called 3x, for all the vars. This behavior is undefined. To fix it we can do initialization like:\nclass Table \n{\n    Table (const Table&amp;); //copy constructor\n    Table&amp; operator = (const Table&amp;); //copy assignment\n}\n\nThere's a block about the impl, but I don't really get it to be honest. They're initalizing things weirdly and using the delete keyword to erase things manually?\nclass Club {\n    string name;\n    Table members;\n    Date date;\n    Club(const string&amp; n, Date d);\n\n    Club::Club(const string&amp; n, Date d)\n        : name(n), members(), date(d)\n        {\n            ...\n        }\n}\n\nIf a member constructor needs no arguments, the member doesn't need to be mentioned in the initializer.\nFor types which initialization differs from assignment (that is without default contructors), it's necessary to initialize:\nclass X\n{\n    const int i;\n    Club&amp; c;\n\n    X(int ii, constr string&amp; n, Club&amp; c) : i(ii), c(n, d) {}\n}\n\nTo create a pointer to a class... Always initialize it!\nconst int Curious::c1;\nconst int* p = &amp;Curious::c1;\n\nTo add have manager to be added in a list of employees:\nstruct Manager : public Employee\n{\n    list&lt;Employee*&gt; group;\n    ...\n}\n\nA derived class can always be assinged to it's base. But never the other way around:\nEmployee* pe = &amp;manager;\nManager* pm = &amp;employee;\n\nA member of a derived class can use the public and protectd members of is base class. However, it can't use private names.\nFirst the derived class is destroyed, then the members, then the base.\nIf you have vars that have to be initialized in the base, you need to call the base's constructor on the derived class:\n\nManager::Manager(const string&amp; n, int d)\n        : Employee (n , d) , // initialize base\n\nI have to develop my own copy assignment operators because otherwise the compiler will create it (and that might be incomplete).\nTo get polymorphic behavior in C++ the member functions called must be virtual and objs must be manipulated through pointers or references.\nAbstract class when all methods are virtual. Classes that aren't \"real things\" like a Shape class. It's merely an interface for other classes and no object can be created.\nWhen you're building abstract classes you should assume the class requires cleanup. So you have to define a virtual destructur in the base class:\nIval_box::~Ival_box()\n\nAnd in the derived class you get rid of the the base class stuff explicitly:\n    void f(Ival_box* p)\n    ...\n    delete p;\n\nOn the note of static things, to declare variables as static inside of a class can greatly contribute for code readability and space saving.\nClass static data members have class scope. To access it you need to add the scope resolution operator:\nMartians::martianCount\n\nThe plan is to go through some of these tomorrow:\n\n\nrefresh my pointers perspective\n\n\nc++ concurrency in action 1 through 7? or 8? or less?\n\n\nchapter 22, 23, 24 of elements of programming interviews\n\n\nread proxy classes 10.8 on deitel to reinforce the \"separate interface from implementation and hide the implementation details\" vibe\n\n\nmemory concepts deitel, there are probably things I forgot about\n\n\npointer to void bjarne page 100, I'm curious about intrinsics\n\nmaybe structures page 101\n\n\n\n","id":"https://cyborgdream.github.io/cpp-classes/","title":"C++ classes"},"https://cyborgdream.github.io/cpp-concurrency/":{"body":"C++11 for concurrency\nC++ references allow you to create a new name for an existing object.\nRvalues are typically temp. (unless you do fancy const tricks). So they're very related to the idea of moving.\nNow I understand the whole copy stuff, it's really because you're not sure if the compiler is doing the right stuff.\nRvalues references only bind to rvalues, never to lvalues.\nint&amp;&amp; i = 42;\nint&amp;&amp; i = j;\n\nThis is how you implement a copy constructor and a move constructor:\nX(const X&amp; other):\n    data(new int[100])\n    {\n        std::copy(other.data, other.data+100, data);\n    }\n\nX(X&amp;&amp; other):\n    data(other.data)\n    {\n        other.data = nullptr;\n    }\n\nIn the case of the move const. you just copy the pointer to the data and leave the other instance with a nullptr.\nThese static_cast&lt;X&amp;&amp; and std::move() are equivalent.\nX x1;\nX x2 = std::move(x1);\nX x3 = static_cast&lt;X&amp;&amp;&gt;(x2);\n\nMove semantics are used in Thread Libraries a lot as an optimization mechanism to avoid expensive copies that are going to be destroyed anyway.\nWhen you create templates with rvalue references, you allow for a single function template to accept both lvalue and rvalue parameters. So something like foo(42); evaluates to &lt;int&gt;(42) while foo(i) assuming int i = 43; will evaluate to foo&lt;int&amp;&gt;(i).\nTo declare a constructor as default means...?\nAnd wtf is a trivial constructor? And copy assignment operators and destructors? I know they can be copied with memcpy and memmove.\nActual concurrency\nThere are two basic approaches to concurrency. The first is to have multiple single-threaded processes, the second to have multiple threads in a single process. C++ will commonly take the approch of the later, but weird stuff like Erlang likes to do the first: spawning millions of thread and letting them fail thing that Fabi was talking about.\nThere's a cost in concunrrency of lauching a thread, because the OS has to llocate kernel resources and stack space and add the new thread to the scheduller.\njoin() is a way to telling the base thread to wait for the spawned one.\nBoth of the following syntaxes just create new thread objects but don't really spawn them:\nstd::thread my_thread((background_task()));\nstd::thread my_thread{background_task()};\n\nYou can also use lambda expressions:\nstd::thread my_t([] (\n    do_smth();\n    do_more();\n));\n\nOnce the thread is started it's necessary to wait for it to finish (by joining it) or leave it to run by its own (by detaching it). If you don't, the thread obj is destroyed. So you must either join or detach a thread even in the presence of exceptions.\nYou have to be aware when detaching things to not destroy them before they finish running. One common way to avoid the scenario of accessing variables that were destroyed is by making the thread function self-contained and copy the data into the thread rather than just share it.\n","id":"https://cyborgdream.github.io/cpp-concurrency/","title":"C++ concurrency"},"https://cyborgdream.github.io/crazy-cpp/":{"body":"I have work from work that I have to finish before Monday.

I decided to attend to their conference to learn more about the community and understand what they were up to nowadays.\nI was happy to see a good amount of representativeness in the event and I felt very welcomed by the people there. There were many interesting talks regarding how to strength open source communities: by using data to understand your user behaviour, using machine learning to try to have a broader understanding of what’s going on in your repositories and other general tips about giving importance to diversity and inclusion. It was a very heart warming environment and I personally I feel like it’s important to attend to this kind of event to keep the flame of the open source and inclusion spirit alive and also mingle between like minded people.\n\nAfter that we moved to Delirium, which is a famous bar in Brussels where everybody attending the conferences get together.

Wow, what an amazing conference, there are at least 20 conferences happening in that one place. You can find a little bit of everything. I met some old friends, got a better idea about projects I didn't know much about, got to know the faces behind the IRC handles of some people, I also learned about some cool projects like A.D 0 and musescore that I didn't know before and which now I'm very interested in contributing to.\nI've watched a couple of talks, way less than I had planned. My schedule consisted of a very well organized list of talks lined up one after the other, fulfilling the whole two days of conferences.\nBut oh well, the rumors were true, FOSDEM is simply too much, it's impossible to watch a full day of talks, unless you stay in a room and never leave it. Instead of watching the dozens of talks I had planned, I watched only a few, fortunately most of them were really interesting. I was also able to get in in all of the rooms I tried to (even though sometimes this meant sitting on the floor).\nMy favorite talks were the ones about Rust, if you don't know Rust head over here to learn more about it! (I immensely encourage you to learn it, whoever you are, whatever your skill levels are). The thing with me now is that I'm in this Sisyphus quest of becoming a better developer and Rust has been teaching me how to in a very natural and pleasant way, likewise, going to the Rust talks not only taught me new amazing things about Rust, but also about how to be a good developer in general. If you're interested in the talks that happened there you can find them in this link. The disclaimer alert here is: take care with what established computer people are saying that's good and bad about coding, be critical, but at the same time, open, and you'll benefit a lot from them.\nFOSDEM was great, very well organized, clean, had some great food (and cheap too!) and I never felt disrespected in any moment. I just wished we had had more diversity on it both in attendees and speakers.\nI was also lucky to be able to go to MOSS, support my friends project's and network with some cool Open Source people and learn about their projects, while enjoying some nice wine and cheese.\nAll in all thanks a lot, FSF, Outreachy, Mozilla, and specially the people, Mike, Karl, Sage, + shout out for the specially amazing people I met in the H building (I don't know enough names!), but thanks to everybody that had an input for me to live this very cool experience. &lt;3\n","id":"https://cyborgdream.github.io/fosdem-2020/","title":"FOSDEM 2020"},"https://cyborgdream.github.io/full-of-cool-things-day/":{"body":"Deving a kernel with loops with Qt\nI'm having an ld: library not found for -lxcanvas, I think it might be trying to link Qt's canvas lib.

But what is HTTP/2? What's the difference between HTTP/1.1, HTTPS and HTTP/2? Newer is always better? How should I know if I should implement it on my website? We'll dive in into the basics and I'll give you the building blocks to understand a little bit about internet protocols and in later articles I'll introduce you to my process of analysis and implementation of an HTTP/2 server focused on improving Webcompat's website performance, hopefully that will give you some insights about how to improve your own server performance.\nHTTP/1.1 stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 1.1 and it's a standardized way of computers talk to each other through hyperlinks. HTTP/1.1 defines methods like GET that retrieves data and POST that sends it, those requests and responses have to be treated synchronous opening one TCP connection for each one of them, which might slow things a bit; HTTP/1.1 implements status there are responses to the methods like 404 not found or 200 that means that a request was successful;and HTTP header fields, which sometimes can be used to fetch data with the HEAD method. HTTP is stateless, which means there is no link between two requests being successively carried out on the same connection, sometimes you may to have a \"memory\" to store preferences of an user or a cart on an e-commerce and for that HTTP implements cookies. HTTP also defines caching, a very relevant tool for performance. Caching is the way to save data locally in order to decrease the number of requests you have to make to another computer, W3C offers extensive documentation about it. If you want to get a deeper understanding on how HTTP/1.1 works MDN has this great overview article about it, you can follow up the links, I recommend reading the entire section.\n\nsource: cloudflare\nHTTPS is a safer way to transfer data between computers. HTTPS websites encrypts the data you send and receive using TLS/SSL and the websites have to be certified by authorities on the internet that ensures that you are exchanging information with who you think you are, here is a link if you're interested in learning more about HTTPS. When we're talking about performance it seems obvious that HTTPS will have a bigger cost than HTTP because of the extra encrypting process, but according to this website's tests their results are pretty similar with HTTPS being approximately 1% slower than HTTP.\nFinally, HTTP/2 implements the same tools that HTTP/1.1 does, but on top of that it has some sweet new stuff. HTTP/2 as opposed to HTTP/1.1 is a multiplexed protocol which means it can handle parallel requests, that often means your page will load faster; it's implemented with a binary protocol which allows the use of improved optimization techniques; it compresses headers; and it allows a server to populate data in a client cache, in advance of it being required, through a mechanism called the server push. Besides that, all of the browsers only support HTTP/2 if they're over TLS which means HTTP/2 websites are always encrypted.\n\nsource: cloudflare\nThese are the basic differences between the three protocols. Now that you have your feet wet on the water it's time to learn how to run analysis and find out if HTTP/2 is good for you.\nIn my previous blog post I gave a small introduction to the main differences between the HTTP protocol versions. In this article I want to help you understand if you need HTTP/2 on your website. If you decide you do you can keep following this series of blog posts where I'll upgrade my own website and where I try in the best of my ability to give you some neat tips on how to analyse and upgrade yours!\nIs HTTP/2 worth&nbsp;it?\nEven though using HTTP/2 is broadly advertised on the internet as the best possible option I don't believe it fits everybody needs. Here are some things to consider if implementing HTTP/2 is worth it for you:\n\n\nIt's not supported by older browsers. You can check here which browsers support HTTP/2. If you know your user base accesses your website mainly from these browsers, it might not be worth it. Maybe it'll be a better use of your time to look for optimizations for HTTP/1.1, those can help a lot;\n\n\nIt's not supported by some web servers. You should check if your current server supports HTTP/2, here is an updated list on which servers currently support it;\n\n\nIt's not supported by some content delivery networks. You should check it either by looking at their website or checking this list;\n\n\nUpgrading your whole ecosystem to run a HTTP/2 server might mean you'll spend a lot of time/money. Besides upgrading your web server and your content delivery network, you might also need to buy a certificate, you can find more information about it here;\n\n\nYou can upgrade your HTTP/1.1 server to HTTPS, so access to HTTPS alone is not a good reason to upgrade to HTTP/2. HTTP/2 isn't intrisically safe and this article goes over some reasons why;\n\n\nUpdating your web server might mean only a small improvement on loading time and sometimes it might mean a loss in performance. I've seen this happening in some cases while analysing webcompat.com with HTTP/2, and other people have seen the same. The only way to find out if it's going to be worth it for your website is by running a lot of tests.\n\n\nIf you think all of the points above aren't a real issue for you - or if you're willing to deal with them, let's dive in to how to analyze your website! In my next post I'll show you the methods and tools I used to analyze staging.webcompat.com and hopefully this real life example will help you to improve the performance of your own website.\nThis post is the continuation of the series “This is a journey in to HTTP/2”, you’ll find the first post where I talk about the difference between HTTP protocols here and the second one where I advise whether you should or not use HTTP/2 on your own website here. On this post we’ll explore how to find the configuration that fits your needs. Better than giving you a formula that might or might not work for you I’ll try to show you how to find the result that’s going to be optimal for your website.\nInitial setup\nThere are a lot of tools out there to help you evaluate your website’s performance. Here I decided to use Firefox DevTools, Chrome DevTools and sitespeed.io by Wikimedia. Why these tools? They’re simple, easy to use, very customizable and they will cover a representative part of what HTTP/2 is doing in our website. Besides that Firefox, and Sitespeed offer a wide set of awesome open source tools and as a conscious developer that fights for the free web you should contribute with these companies by using them. To run tests on your computer use a real mobile device if you can, I recommend using a Nexus 5. If you don’t have a Nexus 5 at your disposal any mid-range device will do, this list might help you to find something. Concerning internet speed I advise you to use a 5mbps internet connection. If you have a slower internet connection at your disposal it’s fine to run the tests with a lower speed, just remember to use a tool like Throttle to establish a speed your internet supports. Note that if you have an internet speed faster than 5mbps you will also need to throttle it down. To run tests on mobile I believe the 3g slow speed or 300kbps is a good one. You can check how much speed you have at your disposal looking at fast.com and if you’re still feeling insecure about how your network is behaving you can use a tool like Wireshark to monitor it closer.\nIf you’re not comfortable with these tools Google has a great doc about how to use DevTools and Firefox too, Sitespeed also have some fine docs. If you don’t want to learn this kind of thing right now and just jump straight away for the tests and results you can try using WebPageTest, it’s great tool and it’s also open source 🎔. WebPageTest is not as customizable as the tools I first advised you to use, but it’s possible to change a lot of settings on the website, so if you’re looking for simpler tests you should go have a look, it’s really a great tool. I recommend the same settings as I did before: using Nexus 5 for running tests with a slow 3g connection and Chrome and Firefox with a 5mbps connection.\nI recommend you to use this setup because according to my previous research Nexus 5 represents the average setup of a mobile nowadays and the internet speeds also represents the average speed connection throughout the world. If you have more accurate statistics for your main users go ahead and use them!\nTo clarify things here this is the setup I’m using:\nServer: ngnix 1.14.2\nDesktop: MacBook Pro 2018 Mojave\nMobile: Nexus 5 Android 7\nInternet speed: 2mbps/300kbps\n\nP.S.: I have to use 2mbps to run my tests because my internet is currently that bad.\nDefining priorities\nPerformance is about an ocean, you can swim for miles in a lot of different directions but if you don’t focus chances are you’ll be lost in a sea of testing and hardly any insights or improves will come out from there.\n\nsource: xkcd\nIt’s important that you find what are the crucial points that need to be upgraded in your website to avoid getting lost. In my case the main aspects I want to improve are time to first paint and time to be interactive. Once you find what are your main aspects try to identify which files are responsible for triggering them, on my case I found out that two bundle files containing all of the page JS and CSS were the files that dictated the website performance if taking in account these two aspects.\nBesides that define which are the most important pages that you want to optimize and focus on those, in my case I’m most interested in improving the performance of webcompat.com, webcompat.com/issues/new and webcompat.co/issues/#.\nAnother important thing to decide is whether it’s actually valuable for you to run tests using mobile. Running tests on mobile is a boring task, it’s super slow and they’re not the easiest creatures to handle, so if it’s not relevant for your context (which is rare nowadays) I’d say you could skip it. You can use Lighthouse to give you an overview about how your website is handling mobile and maybe if you get good results you could also skip the mobile tests. In my case mobile is relevant because it’s where webcompat has the lowest scores when I run this kind of test and also because a substantial part of our traffic comes from mobile.\n\nPre analysis\nThe push resource has to be used carefully for a couple of reasons, for example it interferes directly with your first paint time, so you have to take watch the size of the files you’re pushing, according to this article you should push files to fill your idle network time and no more. Using DevTools should make fairly simple to find out how much idle time we have between the time an user makes a request and your website starts responding it. You can also check this link to learn how to do it “elegantly”. Here are my results:\n\nWebcompat’s idle time. Time in ms.\nTo get an idea of how HTTP/2 is going to change things I first measured the performance of my website without any change. You can measure this using Speedtest or Devtools. I recommend to use Speedtest because it’ll probably make your life easier, but if you want to run tests on DevTools it’s okay too. Keep in mind that you should create a new profile to do so, so your addons, cookies, etc don’t have any effects on your profiling, this is a very important step since extensions can have a profound impact on your performance.\n\nWebcompat’s performance with no changes. Time in ms.\nSome explanation here: the “/” stands for webcompat.com, the “new” for webcompat.com/issues/new and the “396” for webcompat.com/issues/396, a random issue.\nThe plan\nPush will send the files you chose for the user before the user browser even requests them and this is the main difference from preloading, but there is a lot of specificities about it and if you’re interested, there is a great article explaining more about them. Because of that we don’t want to push the files every time the user access our page we only want to send them when it’s needed. To do that a good solution is to create a cookie that will indicate to the server if the user needs new information to be pushed or if it doesn;t and the user already has this info cashed on the browser. If you want to learn more about cookies the MDN page is a nice starting point. Here is an example on how to create a session cookie on nginx:\nserver {\n[...]\n    http2_push_preload on;\n    location = / {\n        add_header Set-Cookie \"session=1\";\n        add_header Link $resources;\n    }\n}\n\nmap $http_cookie $resources {\n    \"~*session=1\" \"\";\n    default \"&lt;/style.css&gt;; as=style; rel=preload, &lt;/image1.jpg&gt;; as=image; rel=preload\";\n}\n\nSince we know how much idle time we have we can estimate how many files we can push. In my case I’ll be pushing only two huge bundle files that are critical for my performance improvement. But in case my estimates are wrong I’ll also run tests pushing more files than I think the website can handle. I’ll also run some tests using the HTTP/2 server but not pushing anything so I can analyze how much pushing files are improving performance.\nWhile running the tests I’m interested in looking at four different aspects of the website: time to first paint, speed index, time to start render and time to load all the requests. You can chose the parameters that make more sense to your website. But careful not to take too many things in consideration. Testing a lot of different aspects will not always give you a more accurate answer, in my experience is quite the opposite, testing things that might be unrelated just gave me a lot of work and confusing results.\nTo summarize we’ll be testing the following:\n\nDefault HTTP/2 server (not pushing any files);\nPushing the most crucial files and keeping inside the idle time budget;\nPushing more files than the available idle time.\n\nBesides that maybe it might be smart to use preload as a complement to the files that couldn’t be pushed. It depends on your currently situation, in my case I decided it wasn’t a priority but I’ll come back to it later on this post and I’ll try to give you some insights about it.\nThe test analysis\nTo make the next tests I’ll use Sitespeed! Sitespeed offers you the option to load your configuration as a JSON file, this is the file I used to run my tests:\n{\n  \"browsertime\": {\n    \"iterations\": 5,\n    \"browser\": \"BROWSER\"\n  },\n  \"utc\": true,\n  \"outputFolder\": \"OUTPUT_FOLDER\"\n}\n\nAnd this is the command line I used to run tests on my desktop: docker run --shm-size=1g --rm -v \"($pwd)\":/sitespeed.io sitespeedio/sitespeed.io:7.73 --config config.json https://staging.webcompat.com .\nI wanted to make this report as accurate as possible so I decided to write a Selenium script to login on my website while I was testing. I recommend you looking in to Selenium and Sitespeed docs if you’re interested in creating something alike. The script is pretty straightforward and here is the one I used:\nmodule.exports = {\n  run(context) {\n    return context.runWithDriver((driver) =&gt; {\n      return driver.get('LOGIN_HTML')\n        .then(() =&gt; {          \n          const webdriver = context.webdriver;\n          const until = webdriver.until;\n          const By = webdriver.By;\n\n          const userName = 'USER_LOGIN';\n          const password = 'USER_PASSWORD';\n          driver.findElement(By.name('login')).sendKeys(userName);\n              \n          driver.findElement(By.name('password'))\n                             .sendKeys(password);\n          const loginButton = driver.findElement(\n                                     By.classN* Firefox had a performance consistently worse than Chrome’s on desktop that’s worth an investigation. According to previous tests done on other tools like DevTools and WebPageTest they didn’t used to have such a disparate performance;\n\n                                    *\n                                 In most of the cases just upgrading the server to HTTP/2 doesn't make much difference. I imagine that most of the performance improvement comes from nginx HPACK;\nEven though the time to first paint didn't improve as much as I expected on the single issue page while I was pushing more than just the bundle files on Chrome mobile the TTI had a huge performance increase;\nIf comparing the Speed index the performance was worse in all of the devices in the new issue page while I was pushing more than just the bundle files, which means the new issue page have a smaller idle time and I shouldn't push as many files as I did.ame('btn-block'));\n          loginButton.click();\n          return driver.wait(until.elementLocated(\n                                   By.id('body-webcompat')), 3000);\n        });\n    })\n  }\n};\n\nWhile running the tests on my Nexus 5 I’ve used the following command: sitespeed.io --browsertime.chrome.android.package com.android.chrome --preScript login_mobile.js --config config.json https://staging.webcompat.com , you can learn more about how to use your mobile to run tests on Sitespeed reading their docs. Keep in mind that you have to redirect the user from the login page to the page you want to test directly, otherwise the browser will just cache the information from your first loaded page to the page you’re really trying to test. Maybe this issue explains a little better what I mean.\nUsing all of the knowledge above we can finally run some tests and analyze the results.\n\nWebcompat’s performance without pushing anything. Time in ms.\n\nWebcompat’s performance pushing only crucial files. Time in ms.\n\nWebcompat’s performance pushing more files than idle time supports. Time in ms.\nSeeing this data we can observe a few interesting things:\n\nFirefox and Chrome mobile have a bigger idle time than Chrome, so these environments benefit more from push . While pushing more than the budget I had estimate was better for Firefox and Chrome mobile it meant a worsen in performance for Chrome desktop;\nFirefox had a performance consistently worse than Chrome’s on desktop that’s worth an investigation. According to previous tests done on other tools like DevTools and WebPageTest they didn’t used to have such a disparate performance;\nIn most of the cases just upgrading the server to HTTP/2 doesn't make much difference. I imagine that most of the performance improvement comes from nginx HPACK;\nEven though the time to first paint didn't improve as much as I expected on the single issue page while I was pushing more than just the bundle files on Chrome mobile the TTI had a huge performance increase;\nIf comparing the Speed index the performance was worse in all of the devices in the new issue page while I was pushing more than just the bundle files, which means the new issue page have a smaller idle time and I shouldn't push as many files as I did.\n\nIf you want to further optimize your website you can try to use preload. I encourage you to read this article about preloading to find out if it’s worth it for you. Generally if you have any of the following on your website it might be a good idea to use it:\n\nFonts referenced by CSS files;\nHero image which is loaded via background-url in your external CSS file;\nCritical inline CSS/JS.\n\nCurrently the website I'm testing doesn't have any critical inline CSS /JS, nor hero image and our fonts are hosted by third-parties. So I decided I wouldn’t make any changes by the time, since I was currently focusing on the push performance. If you’re planning to do that on your website keep in mind that we’ve used http2_push_preload on nginx and now we can’t preload the files on the server anymore because it’s set to default that all of the preloaded files should be pushed. Instead of using the server configuration file and sending them on headers you’ll have to use the preload tag on HTML files.\nConclusion\nAnalyzing the data I got to the conclusion that for my website I should use the push resource on a few other files than I had first planned.

If you felt it before you know how bad and incapacitating this feeling is and that’s why, lately, I’m trying to vanish this thought of my head every time it appears to bug me.\nI didn’t know anything about the topic of my internship one month before I applied to it so everyday while I’m working I learn a bunch of new things and I’m mostly bad at all of them. It’s really hard to accept that you’re new at something and your progress isn’t going to be as fast or as big as the Sr. engineer that’s working by your side. It’s really hard to value your victories and not feel like you’re a fraud when your victories are small and you struggle during hours to learn one concept or how to do this one thing right.\nBut I try to think how far I’ve gone since I began to study about the topics I’m working today and how much I put an effort on the things I do and I feel a little better. Instead of repeating to myself I’m not good enough I try to look for signs that the people who work with me give me saying that I’m doing a good job. And also learning about other’s people experience that are similar to mine help me not to feel alone and help me to question myself: if this woman that is so capable and smart is struggling with the same kind of things that I’m maybe I’m not so bad, maybe we’re just being victims of imposter syndrome and expecting too much from ourselves.\nIt’s a small blog post to thank the wonderful women that I met on Outreachy and say how much I admire them and appreciate the fact that they’re so open about their experiences.

A full day of maintaining libraries, replying comments and PRs and general house-keeping. There's so much non-code work in open source, specially at my job, I feel like, since we provide libraries and softwares to people, all of them have to theoretically be able to run everywhere and that's a lot of work!\nIn the afternoon we had the first webdev meeting and I decided to have fractals in my webiste.\nI want to implement moving fractals.\n\n\nWhich lib is best?\n1.1 3js or p5js or something else?\nSeems like p5js is the way to go if you're going 2d. Seems like I should start here. But Snaeys knows a lot about 3js.\nBut I bet p5js is lighter, so I'm going for this one, also way simpler. Seems like the way to go with 3js is using GLSL shader language, whatever that is (fancy things to game devs?).\n\n\nHow to generate fractals?\nExploring fractals I found this, I want to eventualy do something with phyllotaxis just because 3blue1brown is super cool.\n\n\nI've never checked the code for fractals but they're so simple!

I don't think Sublime in its refined simplicity will be able to do this fancy stuff...

We'll create a file named hello.cpp:\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;void say_hello(const char* name) {\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Hello, \" &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; \"!\" &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n}\n\nStep 2: Creating C++ Python Bindings\nNext, we'll use PyBind11 to create Python bindings for our C++ code. We will create a file named pybind_wrapper.cpp:\n#include &lt;pybind11/pybind11.h&gt;\n#include \"hello.cpp\"\nnamespace py = pybind11;\n\nPYBIND11_MODULE(hello_ext, m) {\n    m.def(\"say_hello\", &amp;say_hello, \"A function that says hello\");\n}\n\nFor this to work, you'll need to have PyBind11 installed. It can be included in your project as a submodule or installed globally.\nStep 3: Writing the setup.py File\nNow, we need to write setup.py, which will build our extension module using setuptools:\nfrom setuptools import setup, Extension\nfrom pybind11.setup_helpers import Pybind11Extension, build_ext\n\next_modules = [\n    Pybind11Extension(\"hello_ext\",\n                      [\"pybind_wrapper.cpp\"],\n                      # Example: passing in the version of the Python extension\n                      define_macros = [('VERSION_INFO', '\"0.0.1\"')],\n                     ),\n]\n\nsetup(\n    name=\"hello-package\",\n    version=\"0.0.1\",\n    author=\"Mari\",\n    description=\"A test package with a C++ extension\",\n    ext_modules=ext_modules,\n    cmdclass={\"build_ext\": build_ext},\n)\n\nStep 4: Building the Wheel\nTo build the wheel, you'll need to install the wheel package if you haven't already:\npip install wheel\n\nThen, you run:\npython setup.py bdist_wheel\n\nThis will compile the C++ code and create a .whl file in the dist directory.\nStep 5: Creating a Conda Package\nTo create a Conda package, you'll need to create a meta.yaml file that Conda-build can use to build your package. The meta.yaml file might look something like this:\npackage:\n  name: hello-package\n  version: \"0.0.1\"\n\nsource:\n  path: .\n\nrequirements:\n  build:\n    - {{ compiler('c') }}\n    - {{ compiler('cxx') }}\n    - python\n    - setuptools\n    - pybind11\n\ntest:\n  imports:\n    - hello_ext\n\nabout:\n  home: \"The URL to the homepage\"\n  license: MIT\n  summary: \"A simple example package with C++ extension\n\nTo build the Conda package, you'll use the conda-build command:\nconda build .\n\nThis will create a Conda package that you can then upload to Anaconda Cloud or install directly.\nTo run it:\npip install /path/to/dist/hello_package-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl\n\nAnd to use it:\nimport hello_ext\n\nhello_ext.say_hello(\"Mari\")\n\n\nThis project could be extended to use CMAKE, in case one has a more complex build than just one C++ file.\nIn a typical Python project without C++ extensions, setup.py is responsible for the entire build process. However, when integrating C++ extensions with CMake, setup.py often delegates the building of the extension to CMake.\n\nYou need to specify if you want your build to be static or dynamically linked: add_library(simplemath STATIC simplemath/simplemath.cpp) if you don’t specify, CMAKE will make it shared by default. You can also use the following flag set(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ON)  # Set the default build type to shared libraries.\n\n","id":"https://cyborgdream.github.io/mixed-builds/","title":"How to create mixed build packages for conda"},"https://cyborgdream.github.io/moral-open-source/":{"body":"Can you be sexist and still be in the managing board of the biggest open source OS out there? Are you too powerful and your views are harmful and unfair to the non-male population and that's why you should be removed?\nI'm reading The righteous mind and the author says that the reason why we come up with moral justifications is not for ourselves, but to convince others of our points of views.\nWe're all telling stories to each other to try to fit in in groups.\nWhen you work in global projects, how can you accommodate so many different cultures and perspectives inside of it? If a person comes from a culture where women must submit to men simply because they're considered to be inferior in all intellectual subjects, what should we do? What should we do when I am a woman and in my moral perspective I am equal to a men in intellectual capacity and feel like I should be heard and considered as equal? How do you even enforce something like this in someone else's moral? According to the writer of the book is not possible.

Hard day to focus on stuff. Don't feel like I got a lot done, but what can you do!\nMore concurrency baby\nWhen copy constructors are marked as delete it's ensured that they're not automatically provided by the compiler.\nCalling detach() on a thread will leave it running on the background (daemon thread, ownership and control are passed over to the C++ Runtime Library. That makes a thread no longer joinable. Can be safe checked using the joinable() method.\nBecause of the risk of not being able to convert a char* to string on the right time (and avoiding dangling pointers) is better to cast it so string before passing the buffer to std::thread. So, instead of std::thread t(f, 3, buffer); do std::thread t(f, 3, std::string(buffer); with char buffer[1024];.\nSometimes you might want to pass stuff by reference to a thread, the problem is that they're oblivious to types of arguments expected by a function, they just blindly copy stuff. TO fix this, is necessary to wrap elements that need to be reference with std::ref(data).\nWhen an object is moved in the thread context, the original object is \"empty\", using move semantics to move stuff to a std::unique_ptr leave the source obj. with a nlptr.\nYou can transfer ownership of threads, by using move semantics.\nstd::thread::hardware_concurrency() will show you how many CPU cores are available to truly run cuncurrent threads. std::accumulate divides the work among the threads.\nIdentifying threads can be done using std::thread::id.\nProblems with sharing data\nInvariant -&gt; a statement that's always true about a particular data structure, e.g this var contains the number of items in the list.\nRace condition: there are several ways to avoid it, the simplest is by wraping your data with a protection mechanism. You can use lock-free programming or mutexes (mutual exclusion). You lock a piece of data and once you're finished, you unlock it. They're not a silver bullet as they have their own issues like deadlocks.\nInstead of locking and unlocking a thread manually it's recommended to use std::lock_guard, which is RAII for mutexes. Here's a simple example of use:\nstd::mutex m;//you can use std::lock_guard if you want to be exception safe \nint i = 0; \nvoid makeACallFromPhoneBooth() \n{\n\n    //The other men wait outside \n    m.lock();// one man gets a hold of the phone booth door and locks it. \n      //man happily talks to his wife from now....\n      std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; \" Hello Wife\" &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n      i++;//no other thread can access variable i until m.unlock() is called\n      //...until now, with no interruption from other men\n    m.unlock();//man unlocks the phone booth door \n}\n\nint main() \n{\n    //This is the main crowd of people uninterested in making a phone call\n\n    //man1 leaves the crowd to go to the phone booth\n    std::thread man1(makeACallFromPhoneBooth);\n    //Although man2 appears to start second, there's a good chance he might\n    //reach the phone booth before man1\n    std::thread man2(makeACallFromPhoneBooth);\n    //And hey, man3 also joined the race to the booth\n    std::thread man3(makeACallFromPhoneBooth);\n\n    man1.join();//man1 finished his phone call and joins the crowd\n    man2.join();//man2 finished his phone call and joins the crowd\n    man3.join();//man3 finished his phone call and joins the crowd\n    return 0;\n}\n\nIf you allow reference data to be called outside the scope of a lock, is bad! Because people can do some injection in your data:\nclass some_data\n{\nint a;\n    std::string b;\npublic:\n    void do_something();\n};\nclass data_wrapper\n{\nprivate:\n    some_data data;\n    std::mutex m;\npublic:\n    template&lt;typename Function&gt;\n    void process_data(Function func)\n    {\n        std::lock_guard&lt;std::mutex&gt; l(m);\n        func(data);\n    }\n};\nsome_data* unprotected;\nvoid malicious_function(some_data&amp; protected_data)\n{\n    unprotected=&amp;protected_data;\n}\ndata_wrapper x;\nvoid foo() {\n    x.process_data(malicious_function);\n    unprotected-&gt;do_something();\n}\n\nSo, deadlocking something is when one thread locks one data that the other thread needs and/or vice-versa. The common advice for avoiding deadlock is to always lock the two mutexes is the same order: if you always lock mutex A before B, then you'll never deadlock. We can use the std::lock function that allows you to lock two or more mutexes at once without risking deadlocks. Here are some other tips:\n\n\navoid nested locks\n\n\navoid calling user supplied code while holding a lock\n\n\nacquire locks in a fixed order (this is a very bad advise, your code shouldn't depend on order, LOL)\n\n\nuse a lock hierarchy\nusing something like \"high level mutex\", \"low level mutex\"\n\n\nSome random stuff\n\n\nweak_pointers are mainly useful to treat cases of cyclical reference;\n\n\ndefault constructor, equivalent to empty constructor. It's good for initializing trivial objects or primitive types\n\n\ndefault destructor, equivalent to empty destructor. calls the superclass destructor\n\n\ncopy assignment operators... here's a crazy issue that this thing brings:\n\n\nclass Buffer {\n    public:\n        Beffuer(int size, int* buffer) : size(size), buffer(buffer) {}\n\n        int size;\n        int* buffer;\n};\n\nconst int kBufSize = 2;\nint* buffer = new int[kBufSize]{1, 2};\n\nBuffer b1 = Buffer(kBufSize, buffer);\n\nBuffer b2 = b1;\nb2.buffer[0] = -2;\n\nSo if we print b1.buffer[0 we'll get -2!

It's a diverse mix of people who want to produce content that is aesthetic, informative, and that expresses diverse and creative opinions. My work as an experimentalist entails developing software experiments that enable and empower the work of my fellow researchers.\nThe theme for this round is \"Centaur Future,\" which is defined as the intersection of man and machine, a forecast of what our society might turn into as AIs become more and more prevalent in our lives.\nCurrently I'm looking into three different little research ideas:\nWe can only control what we understand\nI argue that AI should be controlled either because AI is a driving force for Zerstörung or because AIs will eventually evolve into an existential menace to human kind. I'm not even going as far as to say that AGI is a certain development; I believe it's possible to do a lot of harm with AI even without it achieving this level of intelligence.\nIn order to control the AI we need to understand it, and so far, even though we have been making steady progress[1][2] in the area of interpretability, we have a long way to go.\nThere are many different fronts to explore in the efforts to understand AI. The one I'd like to focus on is working towards simple and understandable models.\nFor that my favorite example is Neural Circuit Policies (NCPs)[3]. The really cool thing about this approach is that is based on a worm's brain[4]! It's the first time we uncovered the entire brain of a somewhat complex animal and we've learned a lot! It spawned the area of NCP, which, in opposition to the current more widely used Transformers model, is an extremely simple network that contains very few nodes. It can be loaded onto small chips and achieve similar results to extremely complex Neural Network implementations[5].\nHaving these ideas in mind, what are the kinds of experiments we can run using these technologies or ideas? Can this be used as material to draw metaphorical questions about our place in technology and the natural world? In an evolutionary perspective, the fact that we're learning so much from such a simple animal is very humbling. What about the influence that this has in art? Can we publicize this idea in palatable way that will awake people's interest?\nCooperation is key\nCooperation was the key to our human dominance over other species[6]; positive cooperation is also, arguably, one of the most difficult issues that human kind ever faced[7]. It's pivotal for us to understand how to cooperate with AI and to enable AI to cooperate and work with each other, as well as with us[8][9].\nI've recently developed the base of a system that allows LLMs to coordinate with each other[10], but I haven't added cooperative capabilities to it yet. There are also safety concerns towards open-sourcing this kind of content. Is this something we should discuss in our report?\nThere are a few open source libraries[11][12] that gives us tool to build cooperation scenarios using Reinforcement Learning (RL).\nWhat kinds of projects can we develop that facilitates or improve these axis of coordination?\nEmergence in simulations\nOne of the most fascinating phenomena I've seen in software development is that of emergence. Emergence of complex patterns is observed in several areas other than software, of course—like fractals in math, markets in economics, and evolution in biology. It's mesmerizing to me to see complexity emerging from simple rules.\nI've never developed my own emergent algorithm, though I've been thinking about this idea for a long time. I would love to tackle this; however, it's hard for me to imagine scenarios where we could create interesting models that could give the public a taste of what AI might become in the following years. I'm extremely cautious when drawing conclusions from models of social behaviors due to the many failures we've had in history[13][14].\nOne way to go is to find a theory we might be interested in and build a simplified model that tries to reproduce it. We might still draw interesting results even if our simulation is far from reality.\nHere are some links to interesting simulation projects I've seen[15][16][17].\nReferences\n[1] https://far.ai/publication/conmy2023acdc/\n[2] https://www.anthropic.com/research\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08554\n[4] http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_celegansintro/celegansintro.html\n[5] https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/new-deep-learning-models-require-fewer-neurons\n[6] https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470015902.a0021910\n[7] https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\n[8] https://www.notion.so/marimeireles/AI-and-coordination-15814d5b41874928b08506a55c92fc61?pvs=4#d305938ccc0a416dabb88072274aba42\n[9] https://www.deepmind.com/publications/open-problems-in-cooperative-ai\n[10] https://techforgoodresearch.substack.com/p/yoasi-a-generative-llm-based-universe\n[11] https://www.deepmind.com/open-source/melting-pot\n[12] https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium\n[13] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World3\n[14] https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/longtermcapital.asp\n[15] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarscape\n[16] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk\n[17] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_It_X7v-1E\n","id":"https://cyborgdream.github.io/new-research/","title":"Centaur Future"},"https://cyborgdream.github.io/not-coding/":{"body":"Saturday after party.

Packages compiled to macOS Intel x86 won’t work in the M1 architecture’s ARM64, for example.\n\nSolving linking problems\n\n\nDynamically linked libraries contain functions, classes, variables, and resources that can be used by multiple programs simultaneously. This promotes code reuse and efficient memory usage. They enable 'dynamic linking' where the linking happens at run time when both executable files and libraries are loaded into memory.\n\n.dylib is OSX, .so is LINUX and .dll on Windows\n\n\n\nldd and nm are used to work with binary files. otool is the OSX tool\n\n\nThe ldd command prints the shared libraries required by each program or shared library passed to it.\nldd /path/to/program\n\n\n\nnm is used to inspect the symbols within object files or binaries and is available as part of the GNU binutils package.\nnm /path/to/object_file\n\n\nFind Symbol Definitions: You can use nm to find out whether a symbol is defined or used in an object file, and whether the symbol is exported (global) or static.\nDebugging Linking Issues: nm is useful for debugging linking problems by showing which symbols are undefined or multiple defined in an object file.\nOptimizing Builds: By examining the symbols, developers can get insights into how to optimize their build (for example, by removing unused static functions)\n\n\n\notool -L to achieve similar functionality to ldd on macOS. This command lists the dynamic library dependencies of a binary.\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of compiled languages like C and C++, symbols refer to these entities (function, classes, variables..) once the code has been compiled into object files (.o), static libraries (.a), shared libraries (.so, .dylib, etc.), or executables.\n\nUndefined Symbols: These are symbols that are referenced in an object file but are defined in a different objec file  or library. They are one of the main causes of linking errors.\n\nObject Files (.o/.obj)\n\nCreation: Generated by the compiler when you compile a C/C++ source file without linking it.\nPurpose: They contain the compiled code of individual source files in a form that can be handled by the linker.\nUsage: Object files are the building blocks that are put together to create either a static library, shared library, or an executable.\n\nStatic Libraries (.a/.lib)\n\nCreation: Created by the archiver tool (like ar in Unix) from one or more object files.\nPurpose: They serve as a single package of multiple object files, allowing for easier distribution and re-use of library code.\nUsage: When you link an application with a static library, the contents of the library are copied into the final executable, resulting in no runtime dependency on the library.\n\nShared Libraries (.so/.dylib/.dll)\n\nCreation: Produced by the linker when building a library that is meant to be shared between multiple executables.\nPurpose: Contain code and data that can be used by multiple executables simultaneously, promoting code reuse and reducing the memory footprint of applications.\nUsage: At runtime, the OS loads the shared library into memory, and different programs can use its code and data without having to have their own copy. This requires that the shared library is available during the runtime on the system where the executable is run.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and answers:\n\n\nHow does the operating system use shared libraries at runtime?\n\nThe executable has a list of required libs. The OS gets the paths and loads them into memory. If multiple apps use the same lib they share the in-memory copy.\n\n\n\nWhat must be ensured for a shared library to be used by an executable at runtime?\n\nThe library must be available on the system where the executable is run, typically in a directory known to the dynamic linker (e.g., specified in LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux).\nThe version of the shared library must be compatible with what the executable was built against.\nProper permissions must be set on the shared library so that the user running the executable has the rights to read and execute it.\n\n\n\nExplain the implication of linking an application with a static library for the final executable. How is this achieved?\n\nWhen an application is linked with a static library, the contents of the static library are incorporated directly into the final executable during the linking phase. This increases the size of the executable since it now contains the library code within it. The implication is that the final executable is larger but self-contained, meaning it doesn't rely on external libraries at runtime. This is achieved using a linker tool that combines object files and static libraries into a single executable binary.\n\n\n\nHow are object files used in creating an executable?\n\nObject files are the result of compiling source code files. During the linking phase, a linker tool takes these object files and combines them, resolving any references or symbols between them (such as function calls or global variables). The linker also includes code from libraries that the application depends on. The result of this process is a single executable file that can be run on the operating system.\n\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of using dynamically linked libraries over statically linked libraries?\n\nReduced Memory Usage: Since shared libraries can be loaded into memory once and shared between multiple running applications, they can reduce the overall memory footprint.\nSmaller Executables: Executables that use dynamic libraries are smaller because they don't contain the library code—they only contain references to the shared libraries.\nEasier Updates: Shared libraries can be updated independently of the executables that use them, allowing for bug fixes and updates without having to recompile the executables.\nModularity: Dynamic linking promotes modularity, as developers can split their applications into separate components that are easier to manage and update.\nResource Sharing: Resources like memory and disk space are used more efficiently because the shared code is not duplicated across multiple executables.\n\n\n\nHow to create a pip package with a fair load of c++ code on it?\n\nFirst create the package structure. Use a tool that will allow you to create a Python-callable interface to the c++ code, kike cython or pybind11.\nThen create a setup.py file that in this case will use setuptools\n\next_modules = [\n    Extension(\n        'my_module.my_cpp_extension',  # Name of the module\n        ['my_module/my_cpp_extension.cpp'],  # C++ source files\n        include_dirs=[\n            get_pybind_include(),  # Path to pybind11 headers\n            '/usr/include/eigen3',  # Path to other headers needed\n        ],\n        language='c++'\n    ),\n]\n\nsetup(\n    name='my_package',\n    version='0.0.1',\n    author='Your Name',\n    author_email='your.email@example.com',\n    url='https://github.com/yourusername/my_package',\n    description='A minimal package with a C++ extension',\n    long_description='',\n    ext_modules=ext_modules,\n    install_requires=['pybind11&gt;=2.5.0'],  # Depend on pybind11\n    setup_requires=['pybind11&gt;=2.5.0'],\n    cmdclass={'build_ext': build_ext},\n    zip_safe=False,\n)\n\n\nBuild the package pip install setuptools wheel and then compile it python setup.py build_ext --inplace. This will generate shared objects. The kinds of objects that will be generated are platform specific.\nTo distribute the package use python [setup.py](http://setup.py/) sdist bdist_wheel to create a wheel and twine to distribute it\n\n\n\nWhat is a wheel? And what’s an egg?\n\nA wheel is a built package that can be installed without a separate build step.\nEggs are older. They’re deprecated and I don’t know how to use them.\nThere are also sdists: archives that contain the source code of the Python package.\n\n\n\n\nDescribing each option from a meta.yml file:\n\nWhat is the host session?\n\nHost: The \"host\" environment contains the dependencies that your package will link against during the build process. When you’re cross-compiling your package you want to make sure that the target system has all the libraries necessary to build your software in their OS. The dependencies that need to be present for the package to compile or run during the build process. These are typically included when the package is installed by an end-user, as they are required for the package to function correctly.\nThis is where the build scripts will look for dependencies to link against or execute during the build process. If you're not cross-compiling, the \"host\" and \"build\" platforms are the same.\nUse selectors in meta.yaml:\nYou can use selectors like # [win] or # [linux] to include dependencies or run scripts conditionally depending on the platform. Here's a simple example:\nrequirements:\n  host:\n    - toolchain  # [linux]\n    - m2-make  # [win]\n\n\n\n\nCan I have pip packages, or conda packages from other channels on my recipe?\nAs a general rule: all dependencies have to be packaged by conda-forge as well. This is necessary to assure ABI compatibility for all our packages.\nSome dependencies are so close to the system that they are not packaged with conda-forge.\nThese dependencies have to be satisfied with Core Dependency Tree (CDT) packages.\nA CDT package consists of repackaged CentOS binaries from the appropriate version,\neither 6 or 7 depending on user choice and platform. We manage the build of CDT\npackages using a centralized repo, conda-forge/cdt-builds,\nas opposed to generating feedstocks for them. (Note that historically we did use feedstocks but this\npractice has been deprecated.) To add a new CDT, make a PR on the\nconda-forge/cdt-builds repo.\n\n\nWhat the hell does this cross-compilation stuff is about anyway?\n\n\nCross-compilation is a technique where you compile a program on one type of system (the host) to run on another type (the target). Cross-compilation is more commonly used when targeting a platform that is not easily accessible or when the build process is much faster or more convenient in this platform. For example:\nEmbedded systems often use processors with different architectures than those in the developers' own computers. For instance, a developer might be using an x86_64 architecture computer but needs to build an application for an ARM architecture-based embedded system, like a Raspberry Pi or a smartphone.\nHere's how it works in this scenario:\n\nDevelopment Machine: The developer has a powerful x86_64 machine running Linux, macOS, or Windows.\nTarget Platform: The application needs to run on an ARM-based device, which has less computing power and might not be suitable for efficient development and compilation.\n\nThe developer will use a cross-compiler on their x86_64 machine that generates executable code for the ARM architecture. This allows the developer to take advantage of the more powerful development machine, speeding up the compile-test-debug cycle. Once the application is ready, the executable can be transferred to the ARM-based device for execution.\nCross-compilation is often faster than native compilation in such cases because the development machine has more resources (CPU, memory, etc.) than the target device. It also avoids the need to set up a full development environment on the target device, which might be constrained in terms of resources or might not be designed for such tasks.\n","id":"https://cyborgdream.github.io/nuggets-packaging/","title":"Packaging in different systems"},"https://cyborgdream.github.io/nurturing-communities/":{"body":"Didn't have so much time for coding.

Sylvain Corlay, the CEO of QuantStack, said that he explained the idea of open source to people, and they told him that if they didn't understand that this [open source] existed, they wouldn't believe such a thing was possible.\nI've never seen open source through these goggles because to me, it was such an obvious effort in the direction we should strive for as a race. But they are, of course, right. Open source is almost unbelievable when you consider the \"normal\" world and the things happening around it.\nI want to better understand how open source happens.\nOne way of doing that is to research how anarchic organizations come into place and understand anarchism better. I've read a few anarchist books throughout my life because it's the political orientation that I agree with the most, but I don't feel like I've done enough. Currently, I'm reading (jeez, I forgot the name):\nSomething something about the criticisms of Anarchism itself; it's a messy and unstructured ideology (it's good but also pretty bad).\n\"Markets Not Capitalism: Individualist Anarchism Against Bosses, Inequality, Corporate Power, and Structural Poverty.\"\n\nIt's also important to understand organizational structures at a higher level. For that, I know Mushtaq Khan is doing important work (https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/mushtaq-khan-institutional-economics/). But who else is relevant? I'm not sure, but definitely something I should pursue too. (God, there's so much context on this link; this is probably a good way to start.)\nAnother important aspect of open source is, of course, open source itself. I have to understand its origin more deeply. I've read countless articles and books from the very creators of the movements we use today, but I don't think I have a good enough understanding of how it came to be and where it's headed. I wonder if the creators or instigators of the movement themselves have an idea of what happened and how, of what's happening right now, and if they have good predictions of what will happen.\nFocusing on the idea of open source studying itself, I think it's always useful to have tons of data. And as important as having data is asking the right questions. I've been avoiding starting to think about these questions because I feel unprepared, but I think the earlier I start, the more iterations I can have, and the better my questions will be. So here's an attempt at some questions that a) I'd like to ask the fathers and mothers (do we have mothers? :/) of the movement and b) my peers who are both researchers and users. Okay:\nWe see a lot of coming and going in open-source projects. It's hard to find maintainers who will do meaningful, useful work, and who will stick around and \"repay\" all the work other maintainers do to onboard them. (Is this perspective of exchange wrong to begin with? I see a lot of this in literature talking about open source. Maybe this very capitalistic perspective on something that's not capitalistic at all is very wrong. Though it is true that maintainers have finite time, and onboarding lots of people and almost never having your work rewarded can be consuming.) So why does this happen in your opinion?\n\nWhy isn't your research open? The benefits of having it peer-reviewed will make it better. You'll be able to discuss it at a deep level with other experts who can go through your data and code and improve it, ask challenging questions. You can share knowledge and advance faster. I understand this might not be the optimal way of dealing with some research because of the monetary incentive that might disappear if it's open. But to what extent is this true? To what extent are people afraid of peers' feedback? Is this all caused by big, evil corporations that just want to make money and don't care about human development? (Am I too naive?)\n\nI think more or less in the same category as the previous question, why aren't scientific papers aiming for open research? I suppose this is because they make a lot of money selling access to their platforms?\n\nOkay, I'll work on my other stuff for now.\n","id":"https://cyborgdream.github.io/open-source-crazy-man-dream/","title":"Open source is a crazy Man's dream"},"https://cyborgdream.github.io/org-projects/":{"body":"On the 25th, I didn't write, but here's what I remember:\n\nI wrote some TODO lists for the different projects I'm engajed on, let's see how this helps me to be organized about things;\nI made a little tiny bit of progress in the data project.

Let's go straight to it!\nPython's memory management\nPython manages memory through a private heap space. It uses algorithms like garbage collection (that keeps tracks of variables and such by reference counting). Memory for variables is not statically allocated, when variables are declared Python infers the data type and allocates memory accordingly.\nWhen thinking about memory management in different threads or in parallel computing then it's also important to understand the role of the Python GIL. \nThe GIL is a kind of lock. When you’re sharing or modifying data using different threads you ideally need something that will keep track of all the changes that are happening, so you avoid data corruption. Only one Python thread can hold the GIL at a time. This means that only one thread can execute Python code at any time, regardless of the number of CPUs. Meaning Python is not truly concurrent, if you define concurrent by being able to run several threads at the same time. You can work around this by using multiprocessing\nTo prevent a Python thread from holding the GIL indefinitely Python causes the current thread every 5ms, releasing the GIL.\nEvery Python standard lib functions that makes a syscall releases the GIL. E. g disk IO, network IO and time.sleep(). Many CPU intensive functions also release the GIL.\nIf one is doing intensive CPU work it’s advisable to use the multiprocessing module, however if one is doing multiple IO-bound tasks, threading is still recommended as most of the time spent on IO is waiting for the IO itself and not processing it or writing it to memory.\nAnother specific Python trait is that it has a garbage collector. The garbage collector exists for every Python process (we will get into what is a process later on). It keeps tracks of the number of variables that we have running on the code. Once these variables are out of scope, their counter goes down, if it goes to 0 the object is deallocated, and its memory is freed. The garbage collector will also delete any variable by the end of a process’ execution.\nPython also employs a cyclic garbage collector because reference counting alone can't deal with cycles — situations where a group of objects reference each other, but are not referenced anywhere else in the code. The cyclic collector periodically searches for such groups of objects and reclaims them.\nThe garbage collector runs automatically during program execution but can also be manually triggered.\nPython processes, threads and coroutines\nFirst, let's get an overview on each one of these terms so we can dive in into the details.\nProcess: an instance of a program running. There are usually hundreds of these going on at the same time and the OS scheduler suspends them periodically to allow other processes to run. Each process has their own memory, meaning they have to communicate with each other through pipes or sockets (which only carry raw bites), that’s why Python objects must be serialized in order to pass from one process to another.\nThread: An execution unit within a process. When a process starts it only has one thread, but it can spawn more. Threads within one process share the same memory space.\nCoroutine: A function that suspends itself and resume later. async def. Python coroutines usually run under a single a thread under one event loop. Frameworks like asyncio, Curio or Trio provide an event loop and support libraries for nonblocking coroutine-based I/O. Coroutines must explicitly cede control with the yield or await keyword, so that another may proceed concurrently may take place. This means any blocking code in a coroutine blocks the execution of the event loop and all other coroutines.\n\nEach instance of Python is a process. You can start additional Python processes using multiprocessing or concurrent.futures. The new spawned process won’t share memory between them.\nPython starts with one thread in which it runs the user’s program and the garbage collector. You can start new thread by using threading or concurrent.futures\n\nI always found these terms very confusing, so here are some extra points on what are the differences between multiprocessing (or parallelization) and multithreading:\n\nIn Python, multithreading involves multiple threads of execution within a single process.\nThreads share the same memory space, which makes for efficient memory usage and easier data sharing.\nDue to the GIL, Python threads are not truly parallel in CPU-bound tasks. Instead, they are useful for I/O-bound tasks where the program spends a lot of time waiting for external events.\nThe threading module is used to implement multithreading in Python.\n\nGraphic interfaces running on Python might use multithreading to keep the GUI running while running some expensive computation on the back. As shown in the following tkinter example:\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom threading import Thread\nimport time\n\ndef long_running_task():\n    # Simulate a long-running task\n    time.sleep(5)\n    print(\"Task finished\")\n\ndef start_task():\n    Thread(target=long_running_task).start()\n\napp = tk.Tk()\napp.geometry('200x100')\n\nstart_button = tk.Button(app, text='Start Task', command=start_task)\nstart_button.pack(pady=20)\n\napp.mainloop()\n\n\nMultiprocessing involves creating multiple processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space.\nThis allows each process to run on a separate CPU core, bypassing the GIL, and therefore can achieve true parallelism in CPU-bound tasks.\nData sharing between processes is more complex and less efficient because it requires inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like queues or shared memory.\nThe multiprocessing module is used to implement multiprocessing in Python.\n\nNow that we cleared these one out there are still one point that might get you confused which is within asyncio and multithreading. So let's dive in to that too.\nBoth asyncio and multithreading are used to deal with I/O in Python. However, there are some differences between both. So, for multithreading you have an extra overhead of having to switch between threads, besides you still have to manage data with locks and such because the GIL is only taking care of that two threads to access the same data at the same time but these data could still be interfered with and produce bad data.\nimport threading\n\n# A shared resource\ncounter = 0\n\n# A lock object to synchronize access to the shared resource\nlock = threading.Lock()\n\ndef increment():\n    global counter\n    with lock:\n        for _ in range(100000):\n            counter += 1\n\ndef decrement():\n    global counter\n    with lock:\n        for _ in range(100000):\n            counter -= 1\n\n# Creating threads\nt1 = threading.Thread(target=increment)\nt2 = threading.Thread(target=decrement)\n\n# Starting threads\nt1.start()\nt2.start()\n\n# Waiting for threads to complete\nt1.join()\nt2.join()\n\nprint(counter)\n\nI think the best use case scenario for multithreading instead of asyncio is when integrating with C extensions. If these libraries are releasing the GIL to compute their own operations it might make sense to keep the architecture consistency. Also when working with Python GUIs as explained above. And of course when your tasks are actually computationally heavy and you need a mix of CPU and IO to deal with them.\nFutures: Futures are found in both contexts of asyncio and multithreading. Though they’re implemented differently in each context.\nIn the context of multithreading, a Future is often called a concurrent.futures.Future, provided by the concurrent.futures module. It represents a future result of a computational task that can be executed in a separate thread or process pool.\nWhen to use asyncio Futures over Tasks:\n\nWhen interfacing with lower-level asynchronous code that uses callbacks (e.g., integrating with a library that doesn't use async/await), you might receive a Future object that you can await.\nWhen you need a cancellable and checkable future that may be set from outside of the coroutine itself.\n\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def set_future_result(future, result):\n    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate work\n    future.set_result(result)\n\nasync def main():\n    # Create a Future object\n    future = asyncio.Future()\n\n    # Schedule setting the future result\n    asyncio.create_task(set_future_result(future, 'Future is done!'))\n\n    # Wait for the future to be set\n    result = await future\n    print(result)\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n\nIn asyncio, a Future is an object that represents the result of work that has not been completed yet. It acts as a placeholder for the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. When you await on a Future in asyncio, you're telling the event loop to continue running other tasks until this Future's result is available.\nWhen to use concurrent.futures.Future over direct multithreading:\n\nWhen you want to execute a computation in a separate thread/process and want an easy way to retrieve its result.\nWhen you want to submit multiple tasks to a thread/process pool and manage their results.\n\nfrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\nimport time\n\ndef compute_square(n):\n    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate work\n    return n * n\n\n# Using ThreadPoolExecutor to execute a function in a separate thread\nwith ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n    # Schedule the execution and get a Future object\n    future = executor.submit(compute_square, 2)\n\n    # Do other things here if needed...\n\n    # Retrieve the result with future.result() which will block until the result is available\n    result = future.result()\n    print(f\"The square of 2 is {result}\")\n\nNuggets of knowledge\nNow that you hopefully have the fundamental definitions we can dive into some specific common problems and their solutions:\nHandling race conditions in Python\nMaking sure a race condition doesn’t happen means making sure no concurrent processes or threads perform conflicting operations on shared resources. One can use locks to achieve that, lock the data and only allow it to be modified after all the relevant operations were completed. One can use the Queue Python module to transfer data between threads. One could use immutable data structures like tuples, to make sure that they’re not being modified. \nOne could also use higher level abstractions like concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor which will manage tasks without the need of taking care of individual locks. Here you don’t need to worry about it because you can use tasks that are schedule.\nHowever, it’s important to note that while ThreadPoolExecutor handles the synchronization of task submission and execution, if your tasks themselves need to modify shared data, you must still handle synchronization within those tasks to avoid race conditions. This is where you might still need to use locks or other synchronization mechanisms, such as those provided by the threading or multiprocessing modules.\nFor example, if you have a counter that is incremented by each task, you would need to ensure that incrementing the counter is an atomic operation to prevent a race condition. This could be done with a lock:\nfrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\nfrom threading import Lock\n\ncounter = 0\nlock = Lock()\n\ndef increment_counter():\n    global counter\n    with lock:\n        counter += 1\n\nwith ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:\n    futures = [executor.submit(increment_counter) for _ in range(100)]\n\n# Wait for all tasks to complete\nfor future in futures:\n    future.result()\n\nprint(counter)\n\nOn side notes you could also use a semaphore, in which you allow a number of threads to use the same memory space. \nThere’s also the Condition API, for example, but I’ve never used it.\nDecorators and optimization\nYou might have heard of decorators in Python. If not, here's a refresher on them:\nDecorators are special Python attributes that allows the developer to change the content of a function. They’re just really syntactic sugar to pass one function as the input of a function and to output them. \nA common case of decorator’s use is in order to trigger events. Here’s an example:\n# A simple event system\n\n# A dictionary to hold event names and their associated callbacks\nevent_registry = {}\n\n# The decorator function for registering callbacks\ndef register_event(event_name):\n    def registrar(func):\n        event_registry.setdefault(event_name, []).append(func)\n        return func\n    return registrar\n\n# Using the decorator to register handlers for specific events\n@register_event('startup')\ndef handle_startup():\n    print(\"Handling startup event.\")\n\n@register_event('shutdown')\ndef handle_shutdown():\n    print(\"Handling shutdown event.\")\n\n# A function to simulate an event and call the registered functions\ndef trigger_event(event_name):\n    for func in event_registry.get(event_name, []):\n        func()\n\n# Simulate events\ntrigger_event('startup')\ntrigger_event('shutdown')\n\nOr in Flask, you can decorate functions with a route, @app.route('index') so when the user is in the index page, trigger the function that was decorated with this route.\nIt can also be used in lazy evaluation situations. In which we store the value of a computation.\nclass LazyProperty:\n    def __init__(self, function):\n        self.function = function\n        self.name = function.__name__\n    \n    def __get__(self, obj, cls):\n        if obj is None:\n            return self\n        value = self.function(obj)\n        setattr(obj, self.name, value)\n        return value\n\nclass ExpensiveObject:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._expensive_attribute = None\n\n    @LazyProperty\n    def expensive_attribute(self):\n        print(\"Computing the expensive attribute...\")\n        # Simulate an expensive computation\n        import time\n        time.sleep(2)  # Delay to simulate expensive computation\n        return \"Expensive Data\"\n\n# Example usage\nobj = ExpensiveObject()\nprint(\"Object created, expensive attribute not computed yet.\")\n# The first access to expensive_attribute will compute and store the value\nprint(obj.expensive_attribute)  \n# Subsequent accesses will use the cached value\nprint(obj.expensive_attribute)\n\nVery useful, somewhat tricky, I always have to re-check how to implement decorators that receive arguments, for example, which consists of the next example. Here we will also dive in to the use of decorators in order to optimize our Python code.\nYou can create a decorator to manage shared resources with a lock (you might recognize this from other optimization libraries like Dask!):\nfrom threading import Lock\n\nlock = Lock()\n\ndef synchronized(lock):\n    def decorator(function):\n        @wraps(function)\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            with lock:\n                return function(*args, **kwargs)\n        return wrapper\n    return decorator\n\n@synchronized(lock)\ndef update_shared_resource(value):\n    # Update shared resource here\n    pass\n\nThe decorator function is needed as an intermediary to correctly bind the lock argument. Without it, you wouldn't be able to pass the lock to the wrapper because the decorator syntax @ expects a function that takes a single function as an argument and returns a callable. You need that extra step to create a closure that captures the lock and uses it in the wrapper.\nIf you didn't need to pass any arguments to your decorator, you could skip the factory part and define a decorator that directly returns the wrapper function. But since you want to pass the lock, you need this extra decorator function.\nYou can also do so much more. You can abstract away the boilerplate code needed to set up parallel execution:\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\nfrom functools import wraps\n\ndef parallelize(function):\n    @wraps(function)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        with Pool(processes=4) as pool:\n            return pool.map(function, args[0])  # Assuming the first argument is iterable.\n    return wrapper\n\n@parallelize\ndef compute_square(numbers):\n    return [number ** 2 for number in numbers]\n\n# When called, this will execute in parallel.\nsquares = compute_square(range(10))\n\nYou can cache results using Python’s from functools import lru_cache. \nYou may also time an execution using decorators:\nimport time\n\ndef timeit(function):\n    @wraps(function)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        start_time = time.time()\n        result = function(*args, **kwargs)\n        end_time = time.time()\n        print(f\"Function {function.__name__} took {end_time - start_time} seconds\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@timeit\ndef parallel_function(data):\n    # Code that runs in parallel\n    pass\n\nThat's it for this post.

The way you create pointers are using the Box&lt;T&gt; keyword. And they're dereferenced the same way you'd do it in C++:\nfn foo() {\n    let x = Box::new(75);\n    println!(\"`x` points to {}\", *x);\n}\n\nThe mutability of the pointer will follow whatever the type is saying, so if you create a type let its pointer won't be mutable, on the other hand a mut pointer would.\nPointers can be returned from a function, if they do, their memory is not freed (meaning there are no dangling pointers in Rust). However, they will eventually go out of scope and therefore will be freed.\nPointers are unique (or linear).\nfn foo() {\n    let x = Box::new(75);\n    let y = x;\n    // x can no longer be accessed\n    // let z = *x;   // Error.\n}\n\nEven if a pointer is passed to another function, it can no longer be accessed:\nfn bar(y: Box&lt;int&gt;) {\n}\n\nfn foo() {\n    let x = Box::new(75);\n    bar(x);\n    // x can no longer be accessed\n    // let z = *x;   // Error.\n}\n\nRust unique pointers are similar to C++ std::unique_ptr. The difference is that this is checked in runtime in C++ and in Rust it's compile time.\nCalling Box::new(x) to an existing x variable won't create a ref. to that value, but will simply copy it.\nfn foo() {\n    let x = 3;\n    let mut y = Box::new(x);\n    *y = 45;\n    println!(\"x is still {}\", x);\n}\n\nRust has move rather than copy semantics, in general.\nBorrowed pointers\nTo have a reference to an existing value we use &amp;, this is the C++ fill for C++ pointer/reference, seems like it works the same as passing an item as a ref. to a function. Use * to deref.\nThe &amp; op. doesn't allocate memory, if a borrowed ref. goes out of scope, no memory is deleted.\nJust like pointers references are immutable by default.\nlets are just a keyword for auto, more or less, they're not really imposing anything.\n","id":"https://cyborgdream.github.io/rust-for-cpp-continues/","title":"C++ to Rust II"},"https://cyborgdream.github.io/rust-for-cpp-pointers/":{"body":"Happy 4/20!!!\nBorrowed pointers part II\nfn foo() {\n    let x = 5;                // type: i32\n    let y = &amp;x;               // type: &amp;i32\n    let z = y;                // type: &amp;i32\n    let w = y;                // type: &amp;i32\n    println!(\"These should all 5: {} {} {}\", *w, *y, *z);\n}\n\nIf a mutable value is borrowed, it becomes immutable for the duration of the borrow, meaning that stuff like the following won't work:\nfn foo() {\n    let mut x = 5;            // type: i32\n    {\n        let y = &amp;x;           // type: &amp;i32\n        //x = 4;              // Error - x has been borrowed\n        println!(\"{}\", x);    // Ok - x can be read\n    }\n}\n\nUnlike C++, Rust won't automatically reference a value for you:\nfn foo(x: &amp;i32) { ... }\n\nfn bar(x: i32, y: Box&lt;i32&gt;) {\n    foo(&amp;x);\n    // foo(x);   // Error - expected &amp;i32, found i32\n    foo(y);      // Ok\n    foo(&amp;*y);    // Also ok, and more explicit, but not good style\n}\n\nIf you have an immutable variable in rust, you are guaranteed it won't change. All mutable vars are unique. If you have a mut var you know it's not going to change unless you change it.\nIn Rust it's not possible to create a borrowed reference that will outlive the reference, the lifetime of the reference must be shorter than the lifetime of the reference value (or at least as long, if I understand it correctly). Example:\nfn foo() {\n    let x = 5;\n    let mut xr = &amp;x;  // Ok - x and xr have the same lifetime\n    {\n        let y = 6;\n        //xr = &amp;y     // Error - xr will outlive y\n    }                 // y is released here\n}                     // x and xr are released here\n\n\nThere's something called explicit lifetimes, and lifetime-polymorphism, that looks like this: &amp;'a T (cf &amp;T) - but it's something for the future.\nI'm skipping Rc and raw pointers cause it seems like an uncertain part of the language.\nData types\nStructs can't be recursive in Rust.\nYou can use let to destructure deep types:\nfn bar(x: (int, int)) {\n    let (a, b) = x;\n    println!(\"x was ({}, {})\", a, b);\n}\n\nEnums are useful in Rust:\nenum Expr {\n    Add(int, int),\n    Or(bool, bool),\n    Lit(int)\n}\n\nfn foo() {\n    let x = Or(true, false);   // x has type Expr\n}\n\nYou can do pretty complex things with it using match:\nfn bar(e: Expr) {\n    match e {\n        Add(x, y) =&gt; println!(\"An `Add` variant: {} + {}\", x, y),\n        Or(..) =&gt; println!(\"An `Or` variant\"),\n        _ =&gt; println!(\"Something else (in this case, a `Lit`)\"),\n    }\n}\n\nKind of beautiful, you also have to treat for all cases.\nMeh, okay I'm bored of reading stuff I want to implement things...\n","id":"https://cyborgdream.github.io/rust-for-cpp-pointers/","title":"C++ to Rust III"},"https://cyborgdream.github.io/rust-for-cpp/":{"body":"I started to read this small book based on a series of blog posts by Nick Cameron which seems like a friendly introduction to Rust for people who came from C++.\nThe first article already gave me some cool insights:\n\nTwo compiler options you should know are -o ex_name to specify the name of the executable and -g to output debug info; you can then debug as expected using gdb or lldb, etc.\n\nYou don't have to specify types in Rust, they can be inferred. We can omit the explicit types with let, but types are required for function arguments. When you don't use an arg. in a function you don't have to name it, you can just _: T. The return type of a function is given after -&gt; if it returns void, you just don't type anything, or you can do -&gt; (). You also don't have to use the return keyword, if the last expr. in a function body (or any other body) is not finished with a semicolo, then it is the return value.\nRust allows you to do this in unsafe blocks, along with many other unsafe things. Crucially, Rust ensures that unsafety in unsafe blocks stays in unsafe blocks and can't affect the rest of your program).\nRust is also memory safe.\nOmg there are no ternaries in Rust.

It does wonders to your state of mind. Because I felt so safe I could join the coolest adventure I've ever boarded in my life. I could take time and choose a job that really resonated with me. And I had the space to realize that I'm no longer stumbling around in the soup of bits and bytes, now I can actually arrange them and tame them to my will (most of the time).\nSteping back and realizing how my skills developed made me feel much more relaxed about my work. It wasn't so much about a steep gain of knowledge, but about the understanding that I don't need to struggle anymore. Most of my anxiety crises related to my self-worth connected to my work as a software engineer are gone. No more stressful afternoons staring at the blank walls that'd echo my thoughts of emptiness and inadequacy, nor more long coding nights filled with guilt and punishment for not being able to finish or understand enough during the working hours, no more struggle with impostor syndrome, no more fear of asking questions.\nWith this new gained perspective I also gained courage to look people in the eyes and contest their ideas, breath through long discussions and take my time to understand different perspectives and hear them with patience, compassion and calmness and the ability to ask for help to face complicated technical issues.\nIt also gave me peace to pursue other passions.

They were the safe shores that'd comfort me after a tough day in school. They were the attention and love of my dad and how we connected the best.\nI was born in a farm and even though my core family was very poor, my extended family was not. That gave me plenty of benefits to enjoy a culturally rich life permeated with technology since my infancy. (Which was very very rare for Brazil countryside by the end of 90's, beginning of 20s).\nAs a kid, I wanted to be an invetor, or a crazy scientist, like the ones I'd see in the cartoons. I used to built \"robots\" out of stuff I'd find around the house and hope that through the right encantation the pieces I put together would make my creature to come to life and interact with me. I think developing software is pretty close to that.\nOkay, to be fair, I also wanted to be the leader of a wolf pack for quite a while, but when I turned 14 and I realized I should start thinking about my career I was convinced it wasn't a great idea.\nWhen the time to university came I didn't choose to study computer science (even though I could have!). I was accepted in a really good university in Brazil and could choose between any of the most prestigious courses, my family not so gently nudged me into choosing electrical engineering. I thought I could build robots there and learn software development but that didn't happen. That was 6 years ago.\nIt was very troubled times in my household and I was going through some deep personal and transformative experiences at the time. I decided to leave my parents house and live by myself.\nLittle did I know what I was getting into. Suddenly there I was, all by myself for the first time in my life. I had a weird contractor job with Facebook in which they could kick me out at any time (and they eventually did), no money saved and a bunch of confusing dreams and hopes. I had to transform myself into an adult and I thought it'd be alright, people do that all the time, right? But I didn't have many of the safety structures that a lot of the people that I was thinking about had. I've been through - what I can now look back and say - the most difficult years of my life. Feeling the soul crushing pressure of capitalism, surviving in a poor unequal society, studying in an abusive environment that couldn't care less for my personal difficulties, fighting a system that homogeonized me as a rich, privileged kid.\nThis dark storm of feelings and events sank me into deep depression. I fought it for many years. And I won. I quit my university and it was the most liberating impactful thing I ever did in my life. I'm so grateful for the people I met and the experiences I lived in that place but also deeply hurt by its toxity and animosity. I became a software engineer. I got a cool job. I did it. But I did it for survival reasons, I had lost my connection with the magic. I was grinding, I was making money, I was studying hard things I didn't care about because that's what my employers wanted from me.\nFor 6 years I have been pushing through life so hard and I'm finally very tired of it. I took a few months off from work thanks to the amazing German health care system. I said, I'm tired, and it was fine, I could actually take a break.

Address families have names that begin with AF. We want AF_INET, but for example AF_BLUETOOTH is another.\n    * A socket has a type, which describes the sort of conversation that’s going to happen. Types have names that begin with SOCK. We want SOCK_STREAM, which means each computer can send arbitrary amounts of data over, but there’s also SOCK_DGRAM, in which case they send each other packets of some fixed size.\n    * A socket has a protocol, which describes the steps by which the two computers will establish a connection. Protocols have names that depend on the address family, but we want IPPROTO_TCP.\n\nNext step is to pick up all of these to create a functional socket.\nNow that we have a socket is possible to connect with other computer as long as we have a DNS and a port.\nNext we can send a request, but there's quite a stiff way to do it:\ns.send(b\"GET /index.html HTTP/1.0\\r\\n\" + \n       b\"Host: example.org\\r\\n\\r\\n\")\n\nThe b stands for raw bytes, it's important to convert this.\nTo read the response, use the \"read\" function of socket. The response comes by parts, so it's necessary to write a loop to gather all of them. Or use the   in Rust. Might be necessary to inform the way newlines are ending: newline=\"\\r\\n\".\nThe response also needs to be split into pieces. It contains:\n\nStatus (don't check HTTP version because of misconfigured servers)\nHeaders (split each line at the first column and fill in a map. Headers are case insensitive, so you can normalize them and remove whitespace)\nBody\n\nNow we can print the content of body while removing all tags.\nI wrote this while I was in the plane and didn't do progress code wise! So...

A thread is a lightweight process that can be managed independently by a scheduler.\n\nDifferences between concurrency and multithreading and parallelism.\n\nMultithreaded programs splits into two ro more threads that may execute concurrently. Each thread acts as an individual program, but they all share the same memory. Switching between threads is faster than switching between processes. Concurrency and parallelism are often considered to be equivalent, but they're not. All parallel programs are concurrent, but not all concurrent programs are parallel. Parallel computing is the simultaneous use of multiple computer resources to solve a computational problem. Each part of the problem must be independent of the others and simultaneously solvable. In other words, a concurrent program can be run in an interleaved way (where each little piece of the software run at a different time) and the parallel concurrency is when you're running something at the same time as other thread.\nIssues\nRace conditions: can occur in any scenario in which two threads can produce different behavior, depending on which thread completes first. They need to both have access to a common object, to run at the same time and at least one of them have to alter the state of the race object. One fix for this besides locking threads iss by creating atomic objects. Here are some doc remiders for this section:\nstd::thread.join()\nstd::thread.deatch()\n\nmutex: can be used to protect shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads. A calling thread owns a mutext, from the time it locks until it calls unlock.\nlock_guard: is a mutex wrapper that provides RAII for owning a mutex for the duration of a scoped block.\n#include &lt;thread&gt;\n#include &lt;mutex&gt;\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n \nint g_i = 0;\nstd::mutex g_i_mutex;  // protects g_i\n \nvoid safe_increment()\n{\n    const std::lock_guard&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock(g_i_mutex);\n    ++g_i;\n \n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"g_i: \" &lt;&lt; g_i &lt;&lt; \"; in thread #\"\n              &lt;&lt; std::this_thread::get_id() &lt;&lt; '\\n';\n \n    // g_i_mutex is automatically released when lock\n    // goes out of scope\n}\n \nint main()\n{\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"g_i: \" &lt;&lt; g_i &lt;&lt; \"; in main()\\n\";\n \n    std::thread t1(safe_increment);\n    std::thread t2(safe_increment);\n \n    t1.join();\n    t2.join();\n \n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"g_i: \" &lt;&lt; g_i &lt;&lt; \"; in main()\\n\";\n}\n\nThe good flux is:\n\ncreate a mutex\nlock_guard the mutex\nThat's all, stuff will fix itself once the thread has finished its job\n\nBut here are some interesting pitfalls that mitigation strategies can bring:\n\ndeadlock\nassuming threads will\n- run in a particuclar order\n- make progress before one thread ends\n\nrelying on tests to find data races and deadlocks\nmemory alllication and freeing, while it's freed in one thread the other one might still need to use it\n\n\n\nstd::atomic: guarantee well defined behavior when being acessed by multiple threads. This is defined by std::memory_order.\ndeadlock: As explained earlier the way to fix race condiftions is by making threads mutually exclusive with things like locks. Deadlocks occur whenever two or more control flos block each other in a way that none can continue. Four conditions have to apply for deadlock to occur:\n\nmutual exclusion (at least one nonshareable resource must be held, (I don't really understand what this means))\nhold and wait (a thread must hold a resource while waiting for the availability of another resource)\nno preemption (resources can't be taken away from a thread while they're being used)\ncircular wait (a thread must wait on another resource on another thread that by its turn is waiting on the resource of the first thread)\nTo fix this issue you can lock the mutexes in a predefined order, which will prevent the circular wait issue.\n\nstd::atomic&lt;unsigned int&gt; BankAccount::globalId(1);\n  \nint deposit(BankAccount *from, BankAccount *to, int amount) {\n  std::mutex *first;\n  std::mutex *second;\n  \n  if (from-&gt;get_id() == to-&gt;get_id()) {\n    return -1; // Indicate error\n  }\n  \n  // Ensure proper ordering for locking.\n  if (from-&gt;get_id() &lt; to-&gt;get_id()) {\n    first = &amp;from-&gt;balanceMutex;\n    second = &amp;to-&gt;balanceMutex;\n  } else {\n    first = &amp;to-&gt;balanceMutex;\n    second = &amp;from-&gt;balanceMutex;\n  }\n  std::lock_guard&lt;std::mutex&gt; firstLock(*first);\n  std::lock_guard&lt;std::mutex&gt; secondLock(*second);\n  \n  // Check for enough balance to transfer.\n  if (from-&gt;get_balance() &gt;= amount) {\n    from-&gt;set_balance(from-&gt;get_balance() - amount);\n    to-&gt;set_balance(to-&gt;get_balance() + amount);\n    return 0;\n  }\n  return -1;\n}\n  \nvoid f(BankAccount *ba1, BankAccount *ba2) {\n  // Perform the deposits.\n  std::thread thr1(deposit, ba1, ba2, 100);\n  std::thread thr2(deposit, ba2, ba1, 100);\n  thr1.join();\n  thr2.join();\n}\n\n","id":"https://cyborgdream.github.io/threading/","title":"Threading issues in C++"},"https://cyborgdream.github.io/tricky-rust/":{"body":"Everything you're hearing now, contributes to turn you into a robot.\nI start this day as I started lots of other days: lurking on twitter. Where I found a very interesting post about \"Hammock driven development\" and when I saw it was taken out of a Rich Hickey's talk I was kinda sold. Interesting approach and it quotes books I have on my shelf and didn't read yet. A small summary: flood your brain with good input when you have to solve a difficult problem and then just rest on the idea, you'll do better.\nSo here are some facts about Rust macros:\n\nyou use them to the detriment of functions when you want to metaprogram. I imagine it's how they substitute templating here;\nthey're more complex than function impls.\nAnother important difference between macros and functions is that you must define macros or bring them into scope before you call them in a file, as opposed to functions you can define anywhere and call anywhere. (I don't reallly get why)\nthe derive attribute?\ndeclarative macros seem to work kinda like a function that has some checks + a python map\npattern syntax (Chapter 18) is the thing they use to make the checks, it looks real ugly\nOh jesus christ, this is just one type of macroing, but there's a whole universe.
