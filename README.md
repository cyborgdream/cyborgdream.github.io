* Use ipy(by Kevin) to create a collaborative foxdot editing feature, [here](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/pull/624/files) is an example of saving stuff through a yjs websocket, but I don't think this is exactly what I want, but might be useful :)
* Re-write this [CSS lib](https://github.com/marimeireles/98.css?organization=marimeireles&organization=marimeireles) so I can use it on my personal website

* Learn about system specific C++ tricks? CMAKE tricks? I can't memorize this shit, I just use it on the go. but I think the question is, are there any good practices, design choices, etc. that makes life easier?
